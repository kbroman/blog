I went to a great talk today by [David Goldstein](http://humangenome.duke.edu/people/david-goldstein), which I might write about further later since he said many of things of considerable interest. But I had to quickly point to an interesting paper he mentioned: [Parachute use to prevent death and major trauma related to gravitational challenge: systematic review of randomised controlled trials](http://www.bmj.com/content/327/7429/1459.full.pdf). The main conclusion:

> We think that everyone might benefit if the most radical protagonists of evidence based medicine organised and participated in a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, crossover trial of the parachute.

Make sure to read the statement regarding the authors' contributions.
