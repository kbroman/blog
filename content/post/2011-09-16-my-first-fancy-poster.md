I'm preparing my first large-format poster (for the MathBio3 conference, here in Madison in two weeks). Previously, my posters had just been on a series of pieces of regular paper. (Consider, for example, [this poster](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/posters/gaw11.pdf) from September, 1998.)  But no one does that anymore, and I don't want to stand out as being archaic.  That is, I want to pretend to be modern.

Here's my draft:

I got a LaTeX template from &#346;aunak Sen, which originally came from [Nathaniel Johnston](http://www.nathanieljohnston.com/2009/08/latex-poster-template/) and uses the [Beamer poster](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/latexbeamerposter.php) style. That made it super easy; I hardly even needed to know what I was doing.

Not having a good sense of how this 1m x 1m poster is actually going to look, I  used Acrobat to print it onto a bunch of pieces of paper ("Tile all pages" in the print dialog), which I then reassembled with scissors and tape.

It looks like it will be fine.

Maybe I should save the \$50 or \$100 and post the black-and-white, pasted-together version?
