I'm just a statistician trying to write software, devise statistical
methods, and muck around with data, to help my scientific
collaborators. I've had no formal training in the politics of higher
education, or even in teaching for that matter. But ugh the shit
that's been happening around [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu) lately. I
need to follow the example of [Anatole
Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatole_Beck) and start speaking
up and speaking out.

wrote two articles in the [Capital Times](https://madison.com/ct/) in
the last year that really pissed me off:

  - 2020-10-24: [UW math lecturer or 30+ years claims 'abuse' of
    academic staff hiring policies](https://madison.com/ct/news/local/education/uw-math-lecturer-of-30-years-claims-abuse-of-academic-staff-hiring-policies/article_d1cded96-5967-5f3b-946e-5aefc65bf159.html)
  - 2021-01-15: [UW rejects instructor's grievance citing 'systemic harassment' in math department hiring](https://madison.com/ct/news/local/education/uw-rejects-instructors-grievance-citing-systemic-harassment-in-math-department-hiring/article_cda84284-d7e0-54ed-a843-1fb64db8352d.html)

Sharad Chandarana had taught in the UW-Madison [math
department](https://math.wisc.edu/) since 1985. But he had not had a
permanent position. Rather, they gave him temporarily appointments for
a semester or a year at a time. And the math department was careful to
offer only a few consecutive years of teaching at a time before laying
him off for a couple of semesters, because there's a university policy
that says if you've been teaching for three or more years they have to
give you a proper position with benefits.

2020 &ndash; 1985 = 35 years, ffs

The email he got from the department on 5 March 2020 said, "As you know,
the university does not allow short term instructor hires for more
than 3 years in a row, after 3 years the position would need to be
converted into a permanent one. There are no current plans for such a
position. I am really sorry about this situation, but because of this
I cannot offer you a teaching assignment for next year.‚Äù

Sharad complained, and the math department forwarded his complaint to the
Academic Staff Appeals Committee, which ultimately voted not to process his
grievance because the department _did not violate university policy_. He
alleged violation of Academic Staff Policies and Procedures, but they
said that didn't apply to him because he had never held a teaching
appointment for three consecutive years.

The university's treatment of Sharad over his career (from
aged 30 to 65, it seems) was just so terrible. And then to say "Well,
it was in accordance with the rules," ugh somehow that's even more
embarrassing.

On 21 March 2021, Sharad announced that he was moving to Florida.
