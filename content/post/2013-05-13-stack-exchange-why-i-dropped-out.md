[Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com) is a series of question-and-answer sites, including [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for programming and [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/) for statistics.  I was [introduced to these sites](https://kbroman.org/blog/2011/09/26/gamified/) at a short talk by [Barry Rowlingson](https://geospaced.blogspot.com/) at the 2011 UseR! meeting, "Why R-help must die!"

These sites have a lot of advantages over R-help: The format is easier to read, math and code can be nicely formatted, the questions are tagged, search is easier, and there should be less redundancy.

### Additional pros

  * It's good to help people.

  * It's fun to rack up reputation points for helping people.

  * It's good exercise, in both thinking about statistical questions and in articulating useful answers (and there are some interesting questions).

### However, some cons

  * The reputation points thing is a bit too addictive to me.

  * The easy questions go fast; you have to watch constantly if you want a chance at them.

  * Far too many questions are either dreadfully dull or terribly sloppy.
(See [Jeromy Anglim](https://jeromyanglim.blogspot.com/)'s "[How to ask me a statistics question](https://jeromyanglim.blogspot.com.au/2011/03/how-to-ask-me-statistics-question.html)" and [Eric S. Raymond](http://catb.org/~esr/)'s "[How to ask questions the smart way](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).")

  * Good answers are, at times, insufficiently appreciated.

### So I gave up

I started spending time on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and [cross-validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com) soon after returning from UseR! 2011, but I lost my patience and quit within three months.

One needs to treat each question with respect, and I eventually seemed to lose my ability to sustain such goodwill.  I think I take things too personally.

### Update

I should clarify: I _do_ continue to use Stack Exchange, mostly through google.  Many problems I run into have already been answered.  I just don't have the right temperament to participate regularly in answering others' questions.
