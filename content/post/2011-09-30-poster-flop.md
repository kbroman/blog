I gave [my first fancy poster](https://kbroman.org/blog/2011/09/16/my-first-fancy-poster/) yesterday, at MathBio3.

I was hoping to use the experience as an opportunity to talk about how great poster sessions can be, and to refer to Terry Speed's old [IMS bulletin column](http://bulletin.imstat.org/category/terences-stuff/) in praise of poster sessions [[pdf](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/terry/Bulletin34_06.pdf)], and then to go on to discuss how, for me, the interpersonal interactions at poster sessions are rather awkward. (For example, if you look at someone's poster for a while, with the presenter standing there watching you, are you obliged to ask a question, or can you slink off?)

However, other than two people I knew and lassoed over, I had just one person look at my poster. (He _was_ nice enough to ask me to explain it.)

What went wrong?  Here are some possibilities:

  * There is some design flaw in my poster

  * I'm scary to look at

  * My poster was in a bad location (at the end rather than the middle)

  * It was 5:30pm and people just wanted to drink

  * I'm a loser

I'm going to conclude _location_.

As at many conferences, the posters were not treated well.

  * The poster abstracts were not distributed (not even titles were given)

  * The poster session was at the end of the day (not last, but next-to-last)

  * The poster session was only 1 hour long, and it started 20 min late (the talks went over time)

They did have 10/30 poster presenters give a 1 minute introduction to their poster, right before the session.  That worked very well (for those 10 people).
