An [R](http://r-project.org) tip:
Did you know that `x[[c(5,3)]]` is the same as `x[[5]][[3]]`?

I should make more thorough use of this.

In the help file for `[[`:

> `[[` can be applied recursively to lists, so that if the single index `i` is a vector of length `p`, `alist[[i]]` is equivalent to `alist[[i1]]...[[ip]]` providing all but the final indexing results in a list.

I never knew this; I came across it when playing around (i.e., not paying proper attention) in the back of the room at an R course.

Did you know that `[[` had a help file?  Type `?"[["`
