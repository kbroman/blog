I was just telling [a distinguished visitor](http://www.stodden.net) a few of my various stories about the [Johns Hopkins **Bloomberg** School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu) [logo](https://www.jhsph.edu/identity/coreIdentity/logoIntro.shtml). She suggested that it would be a great blog topic. And now that I'm a tenured faculty member at a [different university](https://www.wisc.edu) and so can't get into any [further] trouble over this...

Here's the logo:

The logo was newly released while I was a faculty member in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu) at Hopkins.  It was part of a ["branding"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_management) effort for the school that was a near-constant source of amusement for me, though I think I did strain an eye muscle or two from all the rolling.

When the logo was first revealed to the faculty, the website describing it (which was not unlike the current [pedantic website](https://www.jhsph.edu/identity/coreIdentity/logoIntro.shtml) describing the rules for its use) mentioned the "flame of leaning" rather than "of _learning_."  I made the tactical error of pointing this out to the web folks, so it was fixed before we had sufficient time to make fun of it.

In addition, the day the logo was revealed, [someone](https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/people/staff/moffitt.shtml) said it looked like the logo for some religious organization.  A google search for "globe flame logo" instantly revealed the logo for [Missionary Church](https://www.mcusa.org):

Can the similarity be due to chance?

There's more to come on the logo.
