A new academic year has begun, and this year it seems that we're on
our own, when it comes to protecting ourselves against COVID-19.
In the latest guidance from the CDC and UW-Madison, we're told that
"individual responsibility" is sufficient to combat infectious
disease.

From the [UW-Madison FAQ about
COVID](https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/faq/):

> _Is it okay to ask someone I work with if they have been vaccinated?_
> No. A person's vaccination status is private, just like any other
> medical issue or condition, and employees should not be asked to
> share this information.

From the [UW-Madison Mask Policy](https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/mask-policy/):

> _I'm not comfortable being around unmasked people. What can I do?_
> At this stage in the pandemic, our country is transitioning from
> public health orders and mandates to encouragement in using personal
> health tools.

I was part of a group of other workers and community members that
wrote [an open letter to the new UW-Madison Chancellor](https://bit.ly/uwcovidletter)
(which [you can still sign](https://forms.gle/P7jjjqb9yjRiFoQm6)),
expressing concern about the continued COVID-19 health risks and
asking for a more robust response, including indoor air quality
assessments, specific and public mitigation guidelines tied to public
health metrics, mask requirements, improved testing, information on
vaccination rates and COVID testing results, and paid COVID sick leave.

The [Chancellor's
response](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lmqhxdUUzr_mdE5n1sgTJqlvY_naqXR4/view?usp=sharing)
was disappointing, as we discussed in detail in a [column in Tone
Madison](https://tonemadison.com/articles/guest-column-under-mnookin-uw-madison-is-repeating-its-covid-19-mistakes/).

It's clear that the university administration is not going to do any
more to help protect student and employee health. So what can _we_ do?

First, we've [printed a bunch of posters](https://www.wuu.info/news/covid-19-posters/) to encourage good behaviors
and foster a communal feeling. Designed by a local artist, [Meghan
Griffin](https://meghangriffin.com), and funded by the [Wisconsin
University Union (WUU)](https://wuu.info), I hope to plaster campus
with these.

Second, we've designed and created a [low-cost CO<sub>2</sub>
monitor](https://karlduino.org/CO2monitor), and we're making a batch
of 18 of them to lend to people, so they can measure the air
quality/ventilation in their working and teaching spaces.

[![CO2 monitor tied to a wooden post with a pink cord](https://karlduino.org/CO2monitor/docs/pics/co2monitor_sm.jpg)](https://karlduino.org/CO2monitor/docs/pics/co2monitor.jpg)

With the results of that work, we should have data that we can bring
to campus, to get improvements in air ventilation, or at least more
professional assessments of air quality. Further, we will turn to
construction of air filters, such as [Corsi-Rosenthal
Boxes](https://cleanaircrew.org/box-fan-filters/), which people can use
to try to improve the air quality in their working and teaching
spaces, on their own.

The response from UW-Madison and the CDC has been frustrating. The
"individual responsibility" approach to infectious disease is in
complete opposition to everything I understand about public health.
But there are some things we can try to do on our own, and so there is
still some hope.
