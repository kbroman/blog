A new academic year has begun, and this year it seems that we're on
our own, when it comes to protecting ourselves against COVID-19.
In the latest guidance from the CDC and UW-Madison, we're told that
"individual responsibility" is sufficient to combat infectious
disease.

From the [UW-Madison FAQ about
COVID](https://covidresponse.wisc.edu/faq/):

> _Is it okay to ask someone I work with if they have been vaccinated?_
> No. A person's vaccination status is private, just like any other
> medical issue or condition, and employees should not be asked to
> share this information.

From the [UW-Madison Mask Policy]:

> _I'm not comfortable being around unmasked people. What can I do?_
> At this stage in the pandemic, our country is transitioning from
> public health orders and mandates to encouragement in using personal
> health tools.

I was part of a group of other workers and community members that
wrote [an open letter to the new UW-Madison Chancellor](https://bit.ly/uwcovidletter)
(which [you can still sign](https://forms.gle/P7jjjqb9yjRiFoQm6)),
expressing concern about the continued COVID-19 health risks and
asking for a more robust response, including indoor air quality
assessments, specific and public mitigation guidelines tied to public
health metrics, mask requirements, improved testing, information on
vaccination rates and COVID testing results, and paid COVID sick leave.

The [Chancellor's
response](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lmqhxdUUzr_mdE5n1sgTJqlvY_naqXR4/view?usp=sharing)
was disappointing, as we discussed in detail in a [column in Tone
Madison](https://tonemadison.com/articles/guest-column-under-mnookin-uw-madison-is-repeating-its-covid-19-mistakes/).
