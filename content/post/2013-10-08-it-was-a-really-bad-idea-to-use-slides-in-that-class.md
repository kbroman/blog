I gave a presentation in the Statistical Consulting course at UW-Madison today. I've done so a number of times in the past 6 years. Until today, I'd just spoken informally from a few pages of notes. (Earlier this year, I wrote up those notes as a [blog post](https://kbroman.org/blog/2013/04/02/thoughts-on-statistical-consulting/).)

This year, just 45 min before the class, I thought I'd quickly create some slides to present. I thought it'd be an interesting "experiment" (not in the formal sense):

  * Could I quickly create usable slides using the [LateX/Beamer template I wrote about yesterday](https://kbroman.org/blog/2013/10/07/better-looking-latexbeamer-slides/)?

  * Would it be useful to have slides in this class?

The outcome was pretty clear: It was easy to create a bunch of bullet-point-based slides. They look nice. (See the [pdf here](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/teaching/misc/consulting.pdf); [source here](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_StatConsulting.git).)

**But**, the slides themselves worse than useless: Unnecessary, and they interfered with the desired informal nature of the discussion.

I won't be using those slides again. I'll go back to just talking from notes.

Fortunately, the students were really good and involved and asked great questions, anyway. So no real harm done.
