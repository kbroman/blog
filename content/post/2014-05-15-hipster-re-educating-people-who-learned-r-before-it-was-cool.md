This morning, I started [a tutorial for folks whose knowledge of R is (like mine) stuck in 2001.](https://kbroman.org/hipsteR/)

Yesterday I started reading the [Rcpp book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1461468671/7210-20), and on page 4 there's an example using the R function `replicate`, which (a) I'd never heard before, and (b) is super useful.

I mean, I often write code like this, for a bootstrap:

````
x <- rnorm(2500)
sapply(1:1000, function(a) quantile(sample(x, replace=TRUE), c(0.025, 0.975)))
````

But I could just be writing

````
x <- rnorm(100)
replicate(1000, quantile(sample(x, replace=TRUE), c(0.025, 0.975)))
````

"Oh, `replicate` must be some new function." Yeah, new in **R version 1.8, in 2003!**

I'm in serious need of some re-education (e.g., I should be using more of [Hadley Wickham's packages](https://github.com/hadley)). Hence the beginnings of a tutorial.

Note: the title was suggested by [Thomas Lumley](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/showperson?firstname=Thomas&surname=Lumley). No connection to @hspter; it's not really so hip. I probably should have written "geeksteR."
