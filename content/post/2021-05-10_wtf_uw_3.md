I'm in a position of great privilege: a tenured full professor with
solid funding, a history of success in both methodology and
collaborative research, and some well-used software packages. So it
seems wrong for me to complain about a lack of respect.

When I joined the faculty at UW-Madison in 2007, I felt like the
administration had our backs and the state legislators were the only
ones to be concerned about. (Even before [Act
10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Wisconsin_Act_10), it was clear
that state government was not on our side.) But following the
[attacks on tenure and shared
governance](https://www.aaup.org/article/downfall-shared-governance-wisconsin#.YJiINCZOmV4),
I've come to feel that faculty are not viewed as
the heart of the university but rather as an impediment to progress,
and really as expendable cogs in the university machine.

The previous UW System President Ray Cross was straight up on this point:

> Cross compared faculty to railroad brakemen, kept on the job for
> years after they were no longer needed, he said. “It was for the
> same reason — a job for life even when that job was no longer
> necessary.” ([_Capital Times, 2016-05-09_](https://bit.ly/2RH1NPe))

The [merger of the UW colleges with UW
universities](https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/education/university/uw-system-merger-approved-heres-when-the-official-transfer-takes-place/article_aa4d164b-4983-5306-ab53-b1e766bd465c.html)
was a particularly blatant case of the arrogance of UW System
administration, that they know what is best and that there is no
need to consult with faculty.

The [lack of faculty or staff on the search committee for the new UW
System
president](https://www.wpr.org/regents-criticized-not-including-faculty-staff-students-uw-president-search-committee)
showed UW Regents' lack of self-awareness of personal limitations, respect for
university faculty and staff experience and expertise, and really even
the slightness recognition of the value of diversity on a search
committee. Is it any wonder that the committee chose [a white male as
its single
candidate](https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/education/university/uw-system-announces-one-finalist-in-presidential-search/article_ef413237-9d52-540c-8e7f-18e7ae2f5ca8.html),
and one who had just been the subject of a [no-confidence votes at his
university](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/education/2019/10/05/uaa-faculty-reaffirms-no-confidence-in-university-of-alaska-president/)?

It's maybe the smaller things that are most telling. Scheduling
meetings at short notice and at some fixed time ("next Tuesday at
2pm") rather than polling availability, because they don't actually
care if we attend and contribute.

I think of faculty as the heart of the university as we develop the
educational goals, curriculum, and courses, and then we implement
those plans, working directly with students to advance their
skills. But the university administration, and certainly the UW
System administration, instead views us like interchangeable middle
management&mdash;that their high-level view is where the action is.
Faculty are just here to carry out their vision, and if it weren't for
tenure they would replace us with something much more efficient.

(By the way, "privilege" is the word I got wrong in my 6th grade
spelling bee. I came in second, and my mom was really surprised
because my spelling was so bad how could I get 2nd place.)
