A certain photo of me has been following me around for some time.

<p class="caption">Karl with a mustache, 15 Nov 2002</p>

The thing is [sitting on my website](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/pictures/moustache.jpg), so I suppose I have only myself to blame. I actually quite like the photo. I look happy. I _was_ happy. I'm not always happy.

It's shown up in a lot of talks, particularly by [a certain friend of mine](https://rafalab.github.io).

It [appeared on the seminar board](https://twitter.com/StrictlyStat/status/495240349225607169) at [Hopkins Biostat](https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu) earlier this month. Perhaps it's [still there](https://twitter.com/simplystats/status/505066800842047488). ([My own innocent comments](https://twitter.com/simplystats/status/505066800842047488) prompt some of this.)

[Hilary Parker](https://hilaryparker.com) confirmed:

It seems time to tell the story behind the photo. This will probably be longer than it should be. But I've included photos of cats.

### Movember

I think November, 2002, was the first time that a group of young [Hopkins Biostat](https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu) faculty participated in the [Movember Campaign](https://us.movember.com/), in which guys shave and then grow a mustache (or moustache) for a month.

For various reasons, I didn't actually participate. Among the least important: I had a [Van Dyke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Dyke_beard) at the time. It probably took me a couple of months to grow the thing, so damned if I was going to shave it off.

(There was a big controversy during the competition. [Rafa](https://rafalab.github.io) was growing an impressive handlebar mustache, but it was revealed that on weekends or when traveling, he'd grow out the bit on his chin, so that it wouldn't be a proper mustache anymore. I believe he was disqualified.)

### A beard-trimming incident

Now, I thought the whole [Movember](https://us.movember.com/) thing went from Nov 1 to Nov 30. But this photo was taken 15 Nov 2002, and I recall that it was the last day of this [Hopkins Biostat](https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu) competition. Actually, if you look at the [history of Movember](https://us.movember.com/about/history#2003), it seems that _they_ started in 2003, so the Hopkins guys were ahead of their time. (And surely it was [Brian](http://www.bcaffo.com/) who was responsible for this? As I recall, he was trying to introduce some Florida traditions, and [mud bogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_bogging) was viewed to be infeasible.) So maybe we went from Oct 15 to Nov 15?

Anyway, it was the morning of 15 Nov 2002, and I had a bit of an accident with my beard trimmer â€“ I forgot to use the guard or some such. And so I shaved off a big patch of the beard part. Well, it was the last day of the mustache competition, so I figured what the heck, I'll shave it all off, except for the mustache. I think I was made an honorary participant.

### JHSPH Happy Hour

[Biochemistry](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biochemistry-and-molecular-biology/) graduate students organize a Happy Hour every Friday at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu). The [Biostat Faculty](https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu) were enthusiastic participants. (As you may recall, Happy Hour was featured in the whole JHSPH logo saga; see parts [one](https://kbroman.org/blog/2012/11/16/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-1/), [two](https://kbroman.org/blog/2012/11/21/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-2/), and [three](https://kbroman.org/blog/2013/03/06/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-3-karls-revenge/)).

[The photo](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/pictures/moustache) was taken at Happy Hour. So that's why I was happy. (There exists a dual photo of [John McGready](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~jmcgread/), who was a true participant in the competition. But, as I recall, it's hard to detect the presence of a mustache in the photo of John, so it's not gotten the same play.)

### Wilmer dinner

You may ask, "But why were you wearing a proper shirt and a sport coat? This was long after that incident with the Dean, where you were subsequently required to wear a proper shirt on a daily basis."

Well, my wife worked at the [Wilmer Eye Institute](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/wilmer/), and we were going straight from Happy Hour to dinner with a group of her colleagues. I think it was in honor of some important visitor.

Why bring this up? Well, at the dinner, I was sitting next to [Oliver Shein](https://webapps.jhu.edu/namedprofessorships/professorshipdetail.cfm?professorshipID=145), and for reasons that I suspect you can infer quite well yourself, I was unusually exuberant, and I was telling him about the mustache competition. He asked me, "Is there a prize for the winner?" And I responded, "A really bad mustache!"

It was then that I realized the [Oliver Shein is a mustache guy](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/0002003/oliver-schein). Oops.

### The mustache didn't last long

It seems like people think I was a mustache guy myself, from that photo. But it actually lasted just the one day.

### What's really shocking about the photo

I'm not sure why my Hopkins friends are so fascinated by the photo. Possible explanations include

  * the mustache

  * that I look happy

  * that I'm wearing a shirt with a collar

  * that I'm wearing _a sport jacket_

I'm just glad to have people thinking of me, even if I'm not entire sure what they're thinking.
