Yesterday, I saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Ananyo/status/329545985149775873) by [@Ananyo](https://twitter.com/Ananyo)

> Time that biologists stopped telling the public oversimplistic fairy
> tales on Darwinian evolution, says P Ball (\$) [nature.com/nature/journal...](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v496/n7446/full/496419a.html)

So I clicked the link to the Nature paper and realized, "Oh, yeah.  I've got to enter through the UW library website."

But then I thought, "Wait...\$18 for a two-page Nature comment?  WTF?"

So I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/329560393922002944):

> DNA: Celebrate the unknowns, like this Nature comment, which costs
> \$18. [nature.com/nature/journal...](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v496/n7446/full/496419a.html)

And thinking about it some more, I got more annoyed, and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/329566578024775683):

> Why do publishers charge such high per-article fees? At \$18/artcl, you'd have to be desperate or stupid to pay; at \$1-2, prob'ly lots would.

And then I thought, I'll [ask Nature directly](https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/329575795716661250):

> @NatureMagazine Why is the per-article charge so high? It seems like you'd make more profit at \$2/article.

And [they](https://twitter.com/NatureMagazine) [responded](https://twitter.com/NatureMagazine/status/329655405355614210):

> @kwbroman For a while now, individual papers can be rented through @readcube for \$3-5. A full tablet subscription to Nature costs \$35.

But that didn't quite answer my question.  So I [asked](https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/329683444051365889):

> .@NatureMagazine So is the \$18 charge for a 2 pg PDF just to discourage piracy?

I thought a lot about whether to put "piracy" in quotes or not, or whether to write "copyright infringement" instead.

But anyway, they [responded](https://twitter.com/NatureMagazine/status/329692960205725696):

> @kwbroman just as with any product, the more you buy, the more you save. Media/publishing subscriptions have worked this way for decades.

That again didn't quite answer my question.

### It's a scam

I still don't understand the \$18 business.  It's not "The more you buy, the more you save."  It's, "Buy the whole season for \$35, or buy 5 min from Episode 1 for \$18."

I understand that the cover price of [Wired](http://www.wired.com) is \$5 per issue, while I could get a year's subscription for \$15-20.  But that's not the same as \$18 for _one article_ vs \$200 per year.

The \$18 for a two-page PDF is like 900 numbers and paycheck advances.  These are _scams_ taking advantage of desperate or stupid people.

If they don't want to sell the PDFs for individual articles for a reasonable price, they should just not sell them at all.
