This afternoon I refused a request from the American Journal of Human Genetics to review a paper, though the abstract was extremely interesting.  AJHG is published by Elsevier, and I'd signed the declaration at <http://thecostofknowledge.com> to not publish or review for Elsevier journals.  If only AJHG were still with the University of Chicago Press...

Nobody views turning down invitations to review to be a big sacrifice – and publishers will just find someone else. Same thing with editors. But papers are their lifeblood.

I agree with him.  It's easy to turn down a review. (I do so several times a week.)

And so I was feeling quite unsure about turning down the review, but also unsure about breaking the pledge regarding Elsevier.  Nevertheless, I came down on the side of the pledge, and responded to AJHG with the following:

I'm not sure whether it was the right decision.

I think the most important thing for me to do is to work to get [Genetics](http://www.genetics.org) to become open-access, or at least encourage  discussion along those lines at the [Genetics Society of America](http://www.genetics-gsa.org).
