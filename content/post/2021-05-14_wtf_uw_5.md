This is the fifth and final installment of my "Karl is so naive" series.

I've only recently become aware of the big conflict between a graduate
student's mentor's dual roles of advisor and employer. Now I see it
everywhere.

Should they take further courses? No just focus on research.

Should they help out at this software workshop or take on a teaching
assistant position or spend the summer doing an internship in
industry? No focus on our research project.

Should they finish their dissertation now or continue writing for a
few months? Don't waste time on the introductory chapter; just focus
on finishing the papers.

Should they finish their dissertation over the summer and then go find
a postdoc, or should they stay for another year or two, writing a
couple of more papers?

It's maybe not a surprise, given the pressure on faculty to be more
productive, to get those papers out so they can get the next grant.
But it's so painful to see the university treat graduate student
employees as students when it's convenient (when it comes to pay,
benefits, and work hours) and employees otherwise (well, not so much).

Graduate students' salaries are a painful compromise between "pay them
more so we can get better ones" and "don't pay them so much because
it's coming out of my grant." At UW-Madison, graduate student salaries
are severely depressed by the decision a decade ago to charge tuition
to advisors' grants. It would be a lot easier to raise annual salaries
by $6k if not for that annual $12k charge for tuition.

I've been on a couple of dissertation committees where the conflict
was strongly present. Imagine yourself as one of a committee of five
that includes a student's two co-advisors and two others who
[didn't read the thesis](https://kb.wisc.edu/grad/page.php?id=71658).
Criticism of a student's work is often criticism of the advisors, as
the thesis may be an implementation of the advisors' ideas.
