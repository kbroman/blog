Back in 1999, when I interviewed for my first faculty job (in the
[biostatistics
department](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the
[Johns Hopkins School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu)), I got
to meet with the Dean, [Al
Sommer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Sommer). At the time, I
don't think I realized what a treat it was, though it did have an
big impact on me. He talked about how collegial the faculty are at
Hopkins, and also about his [work on vitamin
A](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fs0140-6736%2886%2991157-8), which showed
that an inexpensive vitamin A supplement aimed at reducing childhood
blindness had the surprising result of also reducing mortality.

I remember I asked him two questions: Why were faculty at Hopkins so
collegial (he thought it because they didn't have to compete with each
other for promotion), and why did he leave his important research efforts to
become a Dean (he didn't fully leave research, and he felt like he
could have an even bigger impact by helping to enable others' work).

My point here is, that in my eight years at Hopkins, I really felt
like the focus was on the work itself and the impact it was having,
like the efforts to eradicate smallpox and polio. There was the
whole [Bloomberg
business](https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2001/bloomberg-name.html)
and the [expensive new school
logo](https://kbroman.org/blog/2012/11/16/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-1/),
but even the discussion of the "anonymous" $100 million donation for a
malaria center (at least the part that wasn't about
Bloomberg) was focused on the possibility of eradicating malaria.

In my first couple of years at Hopkins, a number of us junior
biostatistics faculty had a mentoring meeting with [Ron
Brookmeyer](https://ph.ucla.edu/faculty/brookmeyer), at which he suggested
that if you were choosing between writing a substantial methods paper
and writing a grant, he would recommend writing the paper. That it
would have a bigger impact and would also make it easier to get that
next grant.

That's not advice that I can imagine people giving here at
[UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu). Maybe I was just naive, but I
really felt like people at Hopkins were focused on the work first and
the money to enable the work second. Here there's a lot of talk of the
[Wisconsin Idea](https://www.wisc.edu/wisconsin-idea/) and [sifting
and
winnowing](https://news.wisc.edu/sifting-and-winnowing-turns-125/),
but the New Wisconsin Idea is _money_. I mean, "[UW-Madison's economic
impact on
Wisconsin](https://news.wisc.edu/uw-madisons-economic-impact-to-wisconsin-15-billion-annually-study-says/)"
is pretty much what they mean by impact on the state.

The [Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education
(VCRGE)](https://research.wisc.edu/about/leadership/) gives an annual
presentation to the [Faculty
Senate](https://secfac.wisc.edu/governance/faculty-senate/) about
the state of campus research. Now sure, this sort of thing is going to
be pretty heavily focused on money (where do we rank in terms of
research expenditures in relation to other universities and what can
we do to reverse our sliding position), but ugh it's been just so
awful. In 2020 (back when we could meet in person), he said that
Centers and Institutes bring in the big dollars and so to improve our
research rankings we should have more Centers and Institutes. This
year he emphasized faculty involvement on COVID-related research, and
I was thinking "oh cool, here's where he'll talk about research
impact," but no of course he didn't say what they'd actually done but
just that they'd taken advantage of COVID-related research
opportunities to bring in X million dollars in new funding.

At a discussion of faculty who were forming a new Center, the interim director
started a list of _opportunities_ on the white board, and the first
thing on the list was "money". Like, how can we use the Center to get
more money to support our own research?

Another disappointing situation: there was an opportunity for grants
for workshops on reproducible research,
but each campus was allowed to submit just one proposal. Another group
was submitting the proposal, the question was, were they including me
in the effort? Because "if the proposal fails then it's no skin off
our noses by not engaging, but if it goes through then we're probably
out of the game at least in terms of NIH funding. In that case we
could still participate though with no funding for that mandate unless
it's built in now." What mattered was not helping to have the best
possible training available, or even in helping our colleagues to
write a successful proposal, but just on getting some of the money.

More generally, I've felt that with graduate education, there has been
a _much_ bigger focus on getting NIH training grants than on actually
improving the graduate curriculum itself. We don't take time to talk
about how we might improve the existing courses (which is hard);
rather we focus on how to spin the existing curriculum into something
that sounds good in a grant proposal.

Our department meetings now start with announcements of grants that
people have gotten. We don't talk at all about papers people have
published, or talks or workshops people have given, or cool results or
software tools that people have developed. Just grants.

Again, maybe I have just been naive, and that I've just recently grown into
this awareness that scientific research is focused on money first and
results second. Johns Hopkins and UW-Madison differ in a lot of
ways, and a lot of things have changed in the last 15 years, and so
sure this probably isn't a UW-Madison specific problem. But I feel
like academic research here has lost its way. In focusing on
research expenditures as the key measure of research productivity,
they've forgotten that the money is in order to _do stuff_, and it's the
_doing of the stuff_ that should matter, not the money.
