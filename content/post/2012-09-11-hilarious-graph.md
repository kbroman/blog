I read [an interesting post](https://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/the-unexpected-impact-of-coded-appeals/?hp) on the [NY Times](https://nytimes.com) site this morning, which said:

> Analyzing data from the 2008 American National Election Study, we found no relationship between negative feelings toward African-Americans and opposition to government-provided health care among whites without  college degrees. For college-educated whites, however, negative racial feelings were strongly associated with increased opposition to such reform. As the graph below shows, for whites without college degrees, feelings toward African-Americans are unrelated to whether respondents support or oppose government-provided health care. For college-educated whites, however, increases in negative feelings are associated with large increases in opposition to government-provided health care.

They must be right; they have a graph!
