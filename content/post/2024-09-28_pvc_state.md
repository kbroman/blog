Following up on my [post about my heart arrhythmia](https://kbroman.org/blog/2024/09/24/premature-ventricular-complexes/),
and my [post about my current covid infection](https://kbroman.org/blog/2024/09/25/covid-is-so-weird/) too: yesterday
I was wearing my [Polar H10 chest strap](https://www.polar.com/us-en/sensors/h10-heart-rate-sensor) and watching my PVCs on my
[Android app](https://github.com/kbroman/AndroidPolarPVC2), and I noticed _very_ frequent PVCs. My heart seemed to be
alternating between bigeminy (every other beat a PVC) and trigeminy
(every third beat a PVC). I was also feeling particularly crappy from
the covid.

Here's a two minute example of what my heart was doing, with PVCs marked
pink and normal beats marked blue. This has a stretch of trigeminy, a
bit of bigeminy, and then back to trigeminy.

[![ECG data showing stretches of trigeminy and bigeminy](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/bi_tri_geminy_2024-09-27_small.png)](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/bi_tri_geminy_2024-09-27.png)

Today I'm feeling better, and so I thought I'd take the ECG data from
yesterday and identify stretches of bigeminy, trigeminy, or normal
("sinus rhythm", with no PVCs).
I had data just from about 11:45am to 8:30pm, and I compared it
to some data from back in May, where I had data from 6am to the
following 6am.

What I do is turn the heart beats into a string of characters N or P
(or O for omitted), and then look for stretches of beats that fit a
particular pattern. I used a minimum length of 18 beats, either
repeated N, or repeated NP, or repeated NNP.

In the following plot, blue is normal sinus rhythm, orange is bigeminy, and green is
trigeminy. Purple is omitted data, and white is some other state
(except on 2024-09-27 in the lower right, where the patches of white at
the top and bottom are missing data). Time is moving from the lower
left to the upper right, with each row being a single hour.

Wow, each day is really different.

Yesterday (lower-right) I did have a lot of bigeminy (in orange),
alternately with trigeminy (in green). I wish I'd measured the full 24 hours.

The first day here, 2024-05-08 (upper left), has a lot of normal
rhythm, but a big chunk of trigeminy. The next day, 2024-05-10 (upper
right), is almost entirely trigeminy. The third day, 2024-05-12 (lower
left), is more like the first day, though with a lot of trigeminy in
the times that were previously normal rhythm.
