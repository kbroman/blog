I just spent some time updating my
[d3panels](https://kbroman.org/d3panels) library and
[R/qtlcharts](https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts) package for
[D3](https://d3js.org) [version
4](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md). It took just about a
day, and the majority of the time was spent puzzling over
[d3-force](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#forces-d3-force)
and
[d3-brush](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#brushes-d3-brush).

(Note that I just barely know what I'm doing, by which I mean I _don't_
know what I'm doing. I'm able to get things to work, but I don't
always know why.)

I was very glad that I'd written a bunch of tests, because I could use
those to figure out what was working and what was not working, and
whether my changes were effective. _Tests, test, tests._ There's
nothing better than tests for this sort of refactoring business.

I like the changes in D3 version 4, but trying to figure them out
feels a bit like being back in 2012, when I was first trying to
understand D3: I've not found many tutorials that explain how to use
the new version, so I mostly focused on reading the [API
documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md), which
isn't easy for me to understand, or to walk through the code for some
of [Michael Bostock]'s [examples](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock). There
are loads of books and tutorials on D3, but they're almost all still
talking about D3 version 3. (This will change shortly. For example,
the 2nd edition of [Scott Murray](https://alignedleft.com/)'s
excellent [Interactive Data Visualization for the
Web](https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920037316.do) is at the
printer, and covers D3 version 4.)

[Irene Ros](https://twitter.com/ireneros)'s [slides on what's new in D3
V4](https://iros.github.io/d3-v4-whats-new/#1) were super helpful.
(Also I just saw [Tom Roth](https://www.puzzlr.org/sample-page/)'s
nice [tutorial on
d3-force](https://www.puzzlr.org/force-graphs-with-d3/), linked on the
[D3 tutorials page](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Tutorials); duh.)


My D3 code isn't particularly fancy. (And note that I'm still writing
in [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org); I toyed with the idea of
switching to [ES6](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/),
particularly because we can now use `(d) => d.x`.
But I love CoffeeScript and don't want to lose list comprehensions,
and actually my favorite thing is:

```
some_option = chartOpts?.some_option ? the_default
```

I do fight with the indentation at times, but I've grown accustomed to
it.

Anyway, back to the point of this: what did I have to change to get
[d3panels](https://kbroman.org/d3panels) and
[R/qtlcharts](https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts) to work with D3 version
4?

## Simple replacements

The bulk of the changes were simple replacements:

- `d3.scale.linear()` →  `d3.scaleLinear()`
- `d3.svg.line()` → `d3.line()`
- `d3.scale.category20().range()` → `d3.schemeCategory20`
- `d3.random.normal(10,3)` → `d3.randomNormal(10,3)`

Slightly more tricky:
`d3.scale.ordinal().rangeBands([0,w],0,0)` became
`d3.scaleBand().range([0,w])`.

Also, I had written (well, borrowed from somewhere) methods
`.moveToFront()` and `.moveToBack()`, which I can omit as D3 version 4
has `.raise()` and `.lower()`.

So really, the majority of the changes were made by for `d3.`,
making some tiny edit, and then seeing if my tests were working.

## [d3-force](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#forces-d3-force)

My D3 code is rather primitive. I'm basically just drawing and then
adding some `.on("mouseover", something)` or `.on("click",
something_else)` for interactivity.

But force-directed graphics are pretty awesome, particularly for
[beeswarm](https://www.cbs.dtu.dk/~eklund/beeswarm/)-type plots, so I
did make use of `d3.layout.force` in two places.

But I didn't really know what I was doing before, and that made the
change to `d3.forceSimulation` a bit more puzzling. My [code
implementing a beeswarm-type dot
chart](https://github.com/kbroman/d3panels/blob/1.1.4/src/dotchart.coffee#L181-L246)
is really ugly and so not worth looking at or discussing. The [new
version](https://github.com/kbroman/d3panels/blob/master/src/dotchart.coffee#L181-L201)
is just 21 lines (vs 65 lines before), and way easier to read.

For
[`d3panels.dotchart`](https://kbroman.org/d3panels/assets/test/dotchart/),
the main bit looks like this:

```
d3.range(scaledPoints.length).map( (i) ->
    scaledPoints[i].fy = scaledPoints[i].y)

force = d3.forceSimulation(scaledPoints)
      .force("x", d3.forceX((d) -> d.x))
      .force("collide", d3.forceCollide(pointsize*1.1))
      .on("tick", ticked)
```

I have a data set `scaledPoints` which is an array of objects with `x` and `y` values for
point locations. I add `.fy` to each element of the array, to prevent the
`y` values from being changed. (This is a beeswarm-type chart
where the x-axis is a category, and I want those values to be
dynamically adjusted using _the force_, but the y-axis is the
quantitative value, and I don't want those values to change.)

Next I use `d3.forceSimulation`, pass in my data, and then add a force
that makes the points want to go towards their x value another another
force that makes them not collide with each other.

Finally, I have the `ticked` function that does the updating of the
point locations.

```
ticked = () ->
    points.attr("cx", (d) -> d.x)
          .attr("cy", (d) -> d.y)
```

And that's that. There's a bit more code since I want the option of
having the opposite orientation, with the categories on the y-axis and
the quantitative values on the x-axis, but really it's just those 9
lines of code plus a couple of blank lines.

It was hard work figuring them out, but only because I was spending
too much time hacking away without understanding, rather than trying
to come to some understanding before doing any hacking.

## [d3-brush](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#brushes-d3-brush)

The last major thing I had to figure out was d3-brush. I've not
implemented any actual brushing in either
[d3panels](https://kbroman.org/d3panels) or
[R/qtlcharts](https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts), but I did use
`d3.svg.brush` in one my tests of
[`d3panels.scatterplot`](https://kbroman.org/d3panels/assets/test/scatterplot/),
to show that it could be done.

In my [original brush
code](https://github.com/kbroman/d3panels/blob/1.1.4/test/scatterplot/test_scatterplot.coffee#L66-L99),
which was applied for a matrix of three scatterplots, I was creating a
separate brush for each of the three scatterplots. And with the old
`d3.svg.brush()`, you'd pass x- and y-axis scales with `.x()` and
`.y()`.

You don't pass scales to the new `d3.brush()`. Instead, you use
`d3.event.selection` to grab the current selection in screen
coordinates and then have to convert them back to plot coordinates
with your scales' inverses.

But I revised my code to what I thought should be working, and which
was actually working for the first of the three scatterplots, but I
got cryptic errors if I tried to brush the other two scatterplots.
And so finally, in the [revised
code](https://github.com/kbroman/d3panels/blob/master/test/scatterplot/test_scatterplot.coffee#L66-L102),
I decided to use a single brush that was applied across the three
scatterplots. (It seems that you [can implement multiple
brushes](https://bl.ocks.org/ludwigschubert/0236fa8594c4b02711b2606a8f95f605),
but it's complicated.) The single-brush solution is perfectly fine for
my test case, and actually it's maybe easier to understand.

So the conversion from `d3.svg.brush` to `d3.brush` was really pretty
easy. I needed to abandon the multiple brushes, and then the
back-calculation from screen coordinates to plot coordinates is
slightly tedious but not a big deal.

So that was the last thing, and I now have both [d3panels](https://kbroman.org/d3panels) and
[R/qtlcharts](https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts) working for
[D3](https://d3js.org) version 4.

## What's the point?

The point of all this is that I have ideas for further plots I want to
make in [R/qtlcharts](https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts), such as a tool
for exploring pleiotropy (that is, whether two traits are affected by
a common genetic locus, or instead are each controlled by separate but
closely linked loci). For that thing, I wanted a double-slider, and it
seemed best to implement it using D3 version 4, [which I
did](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3/d3doubleslider/). But I
want to use my slider with [d3panels](https://kbroman.org/d3panels), and
really I want to incorporate it into
[R/qtlcharts](https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts), so it was clear that I
needed to spend some time refactoring.

And actually, I was surprised at how easy it was. (I thought it would
be considerably more than a day's work.)
And I feel like I now kind of understand d3-force and d3-brush, so the
effort involved was definitely worthwhile.
