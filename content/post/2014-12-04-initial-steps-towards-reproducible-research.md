In anticipation of next week's [Reproducible Science Hackathon](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/Reproducible-Science-Hackathon-Dec-08-2014) at [NESCent](https://www.nescent.org/), I was thinking about [Christie Bahlai](https://twitter.com/cbahlai)'s post on "[Baby steps for the open-curious](https://practicaldatamanagement.wordpress.com/2014/10/23/baby-steps-for-the-open-curious/)."

Moving from Ye Olde Standard Computational Science Practice to a fully reproducible workflow seems a monumental task, but partially reproducible is better than not-at-all reproducible, and it'd be good to give people some advice on how to get started - to encourage them to get started.

So, I spent some time today writing another of my [minimal tutorials](https://kbroman.org/pages/tutorials), on [initial steps towards reproducible research](https://kbroman.org/steps2rr).

It's a bit rough, and it could _really_ use some examples, but it helped me to get my thoughts together for the [Hackathon](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/Reproducible-Science-Hackathon-Dec-08-2014) and hopefully will be useful to people (and something to build upon).
