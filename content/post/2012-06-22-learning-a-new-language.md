It had been a very long time since I'd tried to learn a new programming language. I started C in 1987, S in 1992, and Perl in 1997, but nothing really new in the subsequent 15 years.

[A friend](http://blog.thebird.nl/) now has me doing [D](http://dlang.org), wanting to find time to learn [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org), and, most recently, playing with [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference) and [D3](https://d3js.org).

I'm really excited about [D3](https://d3js.org). It's long past time for dynamic, interactive graphics to be routine. And with D3, I think it can be.

The object-oriented stuff is most foreign to me.  When your programming skills are stuck in the early 90s, there's a lot to catch up on.  It's hard to adapt to a new way of thinking.  But I've used "`this`" a couple of times, which makes me feel quite accomplished.

The hardest part has been slowing myself down; I'm too impatient. It's critical to have a challenging problem for motivation, but I tend to want to jump into complicated things when I should be a bit more methodical.

I want to make things like [this](https://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111018/collision.html). (I don't really see a use for it yet, but it's fun.)  So I start mucking about with code that I don't yet understand and end up going nowhere for hours.

The important thing is that I'm having fun; eventually I'll be able to usefully apply some new skills.  For now I've got this: [[Click](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3/lod_curve.html) for the dynamic version.]

PS: I really like [Scott Murray's tutorials on D3](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/). After working through those, [other tutorials](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Tutorials) became much more understandable.  [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) is a super-cool, open source, interactive text on JavaScript; also take a look at the "fork" for [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/), [Smooth CoffeeScript](http://autotelicum.github.com/Smooth-CoffeeScript/).  (I'm thinking I'll switch to CoffeeScript once I've learned a bit of JavaScript; the useful libraries and examples are mostly in JavaScript.)
