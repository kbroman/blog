---

This is the new site for my blog; source at [github](https://github.com/kbroman/blog).

I'm going to leave my [old wordpress
site](https://kbroman.wordpress.com/) as it is and not try to figure
out how to move things over.

I'm not been writing much recently, in part because Wordpress is such
a drag to work with. The present site uses
[blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), which is a _joy_. See the
[bookdown-based documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown)
(currently a bit thin)
plus [Amber Thomas's
tutorial](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/) and
the examples at [github.com/rbind](https://github.com/rbind).
Also see my [notes on how I constructed this site](https://github.com/kbroman/ProgrammingNotes/blob/master/blogdown.md).
