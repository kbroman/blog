I got the following email.

<blockquote>
`Subject: i have a question?
Date: May 18, 2012 7:57:56 AM CDT

how can i enter the data of QTL analysis.`
</blockquote>

That was the whole thing.

I presume that the writer wishes to use my [R/qtl](http://www.rqtl.org) software.

I could probably respond helpfully (for example, "See the [sample data files and code](http://www.rqtl.org/sampledata) at the R/qtl web site."), but can't I expect more from people seeking my help?

I suppose there are three options:

  * Just answer the inferred question.

  * Answer the inferred question, but in an offensive way.

  * Ask the writer to provide further details.

I chose the third option, but I probably should have chosen the first.  [A fabulously useful person who I greatly admire](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~ripley/) is well known for his use of the middle option.

* * *

**Update**:

I responded

<blockquote>
`Your question is not answerable without further details.`
</blockquote>

to which the correspondent replied

<blockquote>
`How can i analysis data the by RQTL?`
</blockquote>

I responded with links to [tutorials](http://www.rqtl.org/tutorials), [sample data files](http://www.rqtl.org/sampledata), and [my book with Śaunak Sen](http://www.rqtl.org/book).
