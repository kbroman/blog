I got the following email.

That was the whole thing.

I presume that the writer wishes to use my [R/qtl](https://rqtl.org) software.

I could probably respond helpfully (for example, &ldquo;See the [sample data files and code](https://rqtl.org/sampledata) at the R/qtl web site.&rdquo;), but can't I expect more from people seeking my help?

I suppose there are three options:

  * Just answer the inferred question.

  * Answer the inferred question, but in an offensive way.

  * Ask the writer to provide further details.

I chose the third option, but I probably should have chosen the first.  [A fabulously useful person who I greatly admire](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~ripley/) is well known for his use of the middle option.

* * *

**Update**:

I responded

to which the correspondent replied

I responded with links to [tutorials](https://rqtl.org/tutorials), [sample data files](https://rqtl.org/sampledata), and [my book with Åšaunak Sen](https://rqtl.org/book).
