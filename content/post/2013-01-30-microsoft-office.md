The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com) has [an article](http://nyti.ms/WdR6ya) about how Microsoft will have users pay a yearly fee for MS Office, instead of buying it outright.

There's some mention of competition from [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com). Why should one still use Microsoft Office? The brilliant Excel graphs!

<blockquote>As for Google, Mr. DelBene said it has not "in any way diminished demand" for Office because Microsoft's applications are "just so far beyond the capabilities that are in those alternative products." As an example, he cited a feature in Excel that analyzes a batch of numbers selected by a user and automatically recommends the best way to represent the data in a chart.</blockquote>
