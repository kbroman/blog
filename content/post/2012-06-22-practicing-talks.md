Clay Johnson, the author of [The Information Diet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449304680), recently wrote about [how to prepare to give a presentation](https://lifehacker.com/5920033/how-to-prep-for-a-presentation).

I was shocked.

First, he says

<blockquote>When I started writing my book, I knew that authors generally make more money from speaking than they do from royalties, so I wanted my talks on the Information Diet to be great.</blockquote>

I probably should have stopped there, since we clearly have completely different goals.  He wrote a book and is giving talks in order to make money?

He goes on to suggest a course of preparation that involves an _enormous_ amount of practice.

I guess stand-up comics do that, but me: I'll flip through my slides and think through the tricky bits, but mostly I rely on experience and innate ability.

In [a talk I gave about giving talks](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/giving_talks.pdf), I mentioned that others have said to do 10 practice runs for every presentation.  But for me, my practice run is the time I gave the talk to a different group.  I can't stand the sound of my voice, and I'm certainly not going to watch myself on video, not even [this short one](https://tinyurl.com/7ulrh6z).

Mr. Johnson suggests having a test audience, in part to try out one's jokes.  The intended humor in my talks is almost entirely spontaneous; if I have idea for a joke in advance, I will generally abandon it, as if I think about it too much it will just seem stupid.

The main reason I don't practice talks is that I don't want to waste time; it would take a lot of practice to get just a bit of improvement, and I could spend that time writing or programming or looking at data.

Also, I think if I give a talk too much, by practicing or otherwise, I'll be less excited and interested in the material.  Without practice, I'm not so polished, but I'm more enthusiastic.
