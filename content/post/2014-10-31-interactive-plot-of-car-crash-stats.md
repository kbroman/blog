I spent the afternoon making a [D3](https://d3js.org)-based [interactive version](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3/car_crashes) of the graphs of car crash statistics by state that I'd [discussed yesterday](https://kbroman.org/blog/2014/10/29/improved-graphs-of-car-crash-stats/): my attempt to improve on the graphs in [Mona Chalabi](https://twitter.com/monachalabi)'s [post at 538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/which-state-has-the-worst-drivers/).
