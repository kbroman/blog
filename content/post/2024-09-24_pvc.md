This is a long story about a personal health issue, but it's also
about programming and data analysis.

## PVCs

Early last year, a phlebotomist at the Red Cross (where I was
donating platelets), when taking my pulse, observed that my heart was
doing a bit of tango: beat-beat-pause-beat-beat-pause.

I had an appointment for a physical the following week, so I asked
about it there, and the nurse confirmed the strange pulse rhythm.
The doctor ordered an ECG and a bunch of blood work (which was normal
except for having low iron, since I'd _just_ donated platelets).

While a typical ECG recording is only
for a few seconds, it did catch the odd pattern, which turned
out to be [premature ventricular complexes
(PVCs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ventricular_contraction)
(also known as premature ventricular _contractions_).

Basically, one of the ventricles initiates an extra beat, which happens a bit
closer to the regular beat and causes a bit of a pause afterwards. And
the extra ventricle contraction happens before it's been able to fill
with blood, so it's seen on the ECG but not felt in the pulse.

I've had no symptoms at all. Many others who have PVCs notice them
and may find them disturbing or even painful, but I've felt nothing.

## Initial diagnostics

So they ordered a 24-hour [Holter
monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holter_monitor), a portable ECG
to determine the frequency of these aberrant beats. The results indicated
that, of the about 100k beats over the 24 hours, nearly 20% were these
PVCs.

PVCs are pretty normal. The longer you measure someone's heart
activity, the more likely you'll see a PVC. But typically you'll see
about 2 PVCs in 24 hours, with the 95th percentile being around
200 (see [Marcus
2020](https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.042434)). Seeing
more than 1000 PVCs is pretty rare, and seeing >10% is often viewed as a
problem that should be corrected.

I didn't get to see much of the data (though it was a pretty detailed,
28-page report), but there was a table with number of beats and PVCs by
hour, which showed a clear association with heart rate: the frequency
of PVCs is much higher when my heart rate is elevated (that is, when
I'm exercising). Here's a graph, with each dot being one hour during
the 24-hour period. When my heart rate was below 80 bpm, the frequency of
PVCs was around 10%, while when my heart rate was above 80 bpm, the
frequency of PVCs was around 25%.

[![PVC percent vs heart rate by hour](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/pvc_v_hr_holter_small.png)](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/pvc_v_hr_holter.png)

They had also ordered an
[echocardiogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiography),
which was scheduled a month later. The echo (ultrasound imaging of the
heart) seeks to look for general problems with the heart's shape and
functioning: are things the right size and thickness, are the valves
working right, is it pushing out the appropriate amount of blood?
Everything looked normal, except for the frequent PVCs which interfered
somewhat with the technician's ability to measure the [left ventricular
ejection fraction
(LVEF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_fraction), which is a
key measure of heart function.

## Home ECG

Since I've had no symptoms, I looked for ways to be able to measure
the PVCs myself. My apple watch has an ECG function, but it is kind of
finicky.

So I purchased a [Kardia 6-lead
ECG](https://store.kardia.com/products/kardiamobile6l), which is
similar to the apple watch in that you have to stop everything and
measure the ECG, but it is much easier to use and gives more detail,
so the presence of PVCs are very clear.

Here's a typical image, which shows two normal beats, a PVC, and then
another normal beat.

[![Kardia 6-lead ECG trace showing two normal beats, a PVC, and then a
normal beat](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/kardia_pvc_small.png)](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/kardia_pvc.png)

The Kardia measures 30 seconds at a time, and so
I spent a some time thinking about study designs to get a good
understanding of the overall percent PVCs over the course of a day
when you can see just individual 30 second windows. But I didn't make
much progress on that question. The Kardia gives good data so you can
see what's going on in the moment, but it's hard to see how best to
use it to characterize the overall situation.

Use of the Kardia did make clear the association between PVCs and
exercise, for me. The frequency of PVCs would generally be low when my
heart rate was low but would increase during exercise when my heart
rate was elevated.


## Temporary cardiologist

A full four months after the echocardiogram, I finally got to see a
cardiologist. But it turned out to be a temporary cardiologist. (I
asked him how long he'd been in Madison, and he said he actually was
semi-retired and lived in Arizona and was just here to help work
through the queue at UW Health.) He was very patient and gave good
explanations. But that was the one and only time I was to see him.

He said the key thing was to look for potential heart problems that
could be the cause of the PVCs. The echocardiogram indicated that
there was no enlargement nor problems with heart valves or function,
but he ordered two additional tests: a nuclear stress test (which
could identify blockages) and a cardiac MRI (which would give a more
precise view of heart structure and function). But even if they found
no problems, they would probably want to do something to correct the
PVCs, either through medication or by an ablation procedure (where
they thread a device up through a blood vessel from the groin into the
heart, measure the precise location where the PVCs are being initiated,
and then burn a tiny bit of tissue at that spot using microwaves).


## Further diagnostics

The nuclear stress test was done within a couple of weeks after seeing
the cardiologist. They do a CT scan, inject you with some nuclear
tracing substance, make you run on a treadmill, and then do the
CT scan again. As I understand it, they're looking for blood vessels
that are not getting the tracer, which would indicate a blockage. But
it all looked perfectly fine, other than the very high rate of PVCs when
exercising.

The cardiac MRI was scheduled for three months later. But then I
caught COVID (my first COVID infection) and so it had to be postponed
a couple of more months. The cardiac MRI had some difficulties because
of the frequent PVCs, but indicated possible reduced function of the
left ventricle. (The echocardiogram measured the left ventricle
ejection fraction, LVEF, to be 60%. The cardiac MRI measured the LVEF
to be 47%. Normal LVEF should be around 50-75%.) The possibly reduced
heart function got me an appointment with another cardiologist right
away.

## New medication

The meeting with this cardiologist was brief. His first suggestion was
that I be scheduled to see an electrophysiologist. (It turns out that
there are two kinds of cardiologists: plumbers and electricians. I'd
seen two plumbers, but I really need an electrician.) But that,
of course, would mean another four month delay.

The second suggestion was to change my medication.
I've been taking the beta blocker atenolol for a number of years, to
control blood pressure. It is also supposed to have some effect of
reducing arrhythmias, but he recommended switching to a more modern
beta blocker, metoprolol.

The new medication had no side effects, but my blood pressure clearly
increased, and so they increased the dosage and then increased it
again. At that point my blood pressure was back under control, but
I saw no effect on the PVCs.

I was trying to use the Kardia device to
measure possible changes, but it was tricky, since I could just see
30-second windows. Here is a plot of percent PVC vs heart rate
with the two different medications, which shows the relationship
between PVCs and heart rate, but no obvious effect of medication. Each
dot corresponds to a 30-second window.

[![PVC percent vs heart rate before and after change in medication](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/pvc_v_hr_meds_small.png)](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/pvc_v_hr_meds.png)

The doctor ordered another 24-hour Holter monitor, but it could not be
scheduled for >6 weeks.


## Polar H10

At this point I was quite frustrated with the waiting. It had been
more than a year since the PVCs had been identified, and now I was to
wait all summer, to get the official PVC measurements
and then to finally see an electrophysiologist. In the meantime, I
wanted to find a better way to get continuous data on my PVCs.

After searching for options on the web, I decided to try a [Polar H10
chest-strap heart-rate
sensor](https://www.polar.com/us-en/sensors/h10-heart-rate-sensor). It
costs about $100 and is basically a single-lead ECG with bluetooth.
And Polar provides a [software development kit
(SDK)](https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk) for iPhones and
Android.

There are probably many iPhone apps for the Polar H10, and I picked
basically the first one I found, [ECG
Logger](https://www.ecglogger.com/), and paid $7 to enable its data
download capability, which made it very easy to save data in CSV
files, each containing a one-hour block of time.

And then I immediately started on an R package,
[detectPVC](https://github.com/kbroman/detectPVC/), to analyze and
graph the data. The main challenges were to identify the peaks, to
identify and omit messy intervals from the data, and then to classify
the peaks as normal beats vs PVCs. Here's a stretch of 2 minutes of
data, with the peaks labeled with dots (blue is a normal peak and pink
is a PVC). This is a long stretch of _trigeminy_, where every third
beat is a PVC, which is a very common pattern for me.

[![2 min data from a Polar H10 with a peaks identified as either normal (blue) or PVC (pink)](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/trigeminy_small.png)](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/trigeminy.png)

For the peak finding, I used a function in the R package
[rsleep](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rsleep). (That package has
since been removed from CRAN, but it was released under the [MIT
license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), so I just grabbed
the code for the one function I was using.) To identify messy
intervals, I basically look for signal being > 2 in absolute value or
having excessive missing data.

To classify the peaks as normal beats vs PVCs, I calculated various
statistics on each peak: relative position between previous and
following peaks (usually much closer to previous peak), the height of
the peak (tend to be higher), and how quickly it goes from local
maximum to the next local minimum (tends to be sooner). I ended up
just going with the last of these. I could do more to compare the
shape of the peaks, normal vs PVC, but this simple statistic seemed to
work sufficiently well for my purposes.

It's not super comfortable to wear the chest strap constantly, but I
did try wearing it for 24 hours, and then wore it every other day for
a couple of weeks. Here's a plot of the running average of PVC
percentage over time on nine different days. Note that the last six
days are basically 6am to the following day at 6am, while the times
for the first three days are a bit different.

[![2 min data from a Polar H10 with a peaks identified as either normal (blue) or PVC (pink)](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/pvcs_many_days_small.png)](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/pvcs_many_days.png)

A main feature is the observation I'd had previously: PVCs increase
when I'm exercising and go back down when I'm resting (including at
night). But there is a lot of day-to-day variation, with the overall
percent PVCs being as low as 12% or as high as 28%. Much of this is
just an indicator of how much I had been exercising, but there were
also days (for example, 2024-05-05) where there was a sustained high
rate of PVCs.

I presented some of this data to the cardiologist, basically saying
"With this device I can measure the rate of PVCs, and sometimes it's
really high. Can we try a different medication?"

He was not at all interested, and said to just wait until we got the
Holter monitor, and until I could see the electrophysiologist.


## Android app

The cardiologist wasn't interested, but I had become super interested.
And I really wanted to have a way to look at the PVC percentage in
real time. So I started to look at what it would take to make my own
app, or to modify someone else's.

I decided to focus on Android apps, because it seemed much more likely
that I would find open source software that I could learn from and
build on. So I got myself a Samsung Galaxy phone, got some books on
Android app development, and looked for suitable apps on GitHub.
Writing an Android app involves Java (or
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), which is sort of "Java improved")
and XML, two of my least favorite things, but so be it.

[Kenneth Evans](https://kenevans.net) has an Android app on GitHub,
[KE.Net ECG](https://github.com/KennethEvans/KE.Net-ECG), that is
released under the MIT license and includes both a plot of the ECG
trace as well as a peak-finding algorithm and a plot of heart rate
over time. (The plots are made using the [Android Plot
library](https://github.com/halfhp/androidplot).) That looked
perfect for my purposes, and so I [forked his
code](https://github.com/kbroman/AndroidPolarPVC/tree/add_pvc), and with
just a day's work I was able to add a bit of code to classify peaks as
normal or PVCs and add a read-out of PVC percentage (based on the last
100 peaks):

[![screen shot of modified android app](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/android_app_small.jpg)](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/android_app.jpg)

I wanted to further modify the app to add a plot of the PVC percentage
over time, but digging into the code, it became clear that he was
using an older version of the [Polar
SDK](https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk), and so I decided
to throw it all out and start over, but then I found that I
really didn't understand what I was doing (or what he was doing in his
app), and so I started over, but using a bunch of his code and
following his basic design. The revised app,
[AndroidPolarPVC2](https://github.com/kbroman/AndroidPolarPVC2), shows
the ECG trace with peaks annotated as normal or PVC, as well as a plot
of the PVC percentage and heart rate over time. It can also dump the
ECG data to files, in one hour blocks.

[![screen shot of further improved android app](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/android_app_rev_small.jpg)](https://kbroman.org/blog/images/android_app_rev.jpg)

The result is exactly what I wanted, though its not nearly as robust
as the [ECG Logger](https://www.ecglogger.com/) iPhone app that I had
been using. In particular, it locks up after 90 minutes. I'm not sure
why that happens, and it means I can't use it to dump 24 hours worth
of data, as I'd been doing with the iPhone app. But for
monitoring my PVCs during the day, it works great; I just need to
re-start it every 90 minutes.

## PVC ablation

When I finally met with the electrophysiologist, I wore the chest
strap and brought the Android phone with the app running. I also
brought a few charts to show some of the things I'd observed. But he
showed little interest. He mentioned that there had been attempts
to commercialize similar devices but without success, due to
individual differences in the nature of the PVCs: the classification
of ECG peaks as normal vs PVC would need to be redone for each
patient.

Still, my [R
package](https://github.com/kbroman/detectPVC) and [Android
app](https://github.com/kbroman/AndroidPolarPVC2) work well for me and
could be useful starting points for others.

Anyway, the electrophysiologist talked about possible medications to
reduce the PVCs, but recommended [catheter
ablation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter_ablation): they
thread a device up through a blood vessel from the groin into the
heart, and then burn a tiny bit of tissue where the PVCs are being
initiated. The [success rate is
high](https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fjcm11216583), but there is also
risk of complications (for example, [Wang et al.
2018](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-018-0913-2) reported 2 deaths in
1231 patients). I decided to go ahead with it, and have an appointment
for the procedure in two weeks time.


## When did this start?

It's not really clear what causes PVCs. And it wasn't really clear how
long it's been happening with me. It does appear that the COVID-19
pandemic has led to an increase in cardiac arrhythmias including PVCs
(for example, see [Manolis et al.
2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcm.2020.08.002)). But when my PVCs
were first identified (in April 2023) I hadn't yet had COVID, and I
was testing regularly. (I've had it twice since, despite continuing to
be very cautious to avoid exposure.)

Recently I had a colonoscopy, in which they monitored my heart with a
6-lead ECG. The ECG was beeping the whole time due to the high
frequency of PVCs. (The nurse quickly turned off the alarm, because it
was annoying.) I'd had a colonoscopy at the same clinic in March,
2021, and there had been no noticeable PVCs at that time, so it seems
likely that my PVCs have started since then. But still, it's not
clear why. Maybe it was due to a COVID infection that I never noticed.

I was hoping that by being able to monitor my PVCs, I might learn more
about what's causing them, but I really haven't. I tried cutting
back on caffeine: I now drink exactly one cup of coffee a day, rather
than 3+, but it's had no effect. Hopefully the ablation procedure is
successful. A month from now, I'll put on the chest strap and do a dozen squat
jumps, and we'll see how my heart responds.
