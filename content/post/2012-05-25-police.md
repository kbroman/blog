The other day, I was sitting on campus, in the woods overlooking Lake Mendota, reading a journal article, and a campus police officer came up to me.

The conversation went something like this:

> _Police_: What's going on?
>
> _Me_: I'm enjoying the day.
>
> _Police_: Are you staff?
>
> _Me_: I'm faculty.
>
> _Police_: I'm enjoying the day, too.

And then he walked off.

I'm not sure who was more suspicious, him of me or me of him.  Perhaps he was thinking through the [Prof or Hobo](http://individual.utoronto.ca/somody/quiz.html) quiz.
