We all complain about peer review, particularly when [our best work](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/publications/inversion.pdf) is rejected by every journal from Nature Genetics down to [that journal that will publish anything](https://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcgenet), so that it finally appears in [a volume](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.lnms/1215091126) to honor [some guy](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~terry/) that [only he will read](https://kbroman.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/terry2.jpg).

However, sometimes [an anonymous reviewer](https://medicine.yale.edu/ysph/people/hongyu_zhao.profile) will identify an important flaw in [a paper](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/publications/interfer.pdf) that you can fix before it's published, thus saving you from potential public embarrassment.

That happened to me again today.  I finally got the reviews back for [a paper](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/publications/phyloqtl_combined.pdf), eight weeks after it was submitted.  I had become a bit impatient, but one of the reviewers identified a hole in our theory section, which we can now fix before publication (I think [we](https://www.stat.wisc.edu/~ane/) figured it out this afternoon), thus avoiding public embarrassment, except for the fact that I'm currently pointing it out publicly.

Complaints about the peer review process are not unlike a common complaint about statisticians: that we are a barrier to scientists publishing what they know to be true.  That is sometimes the case, but at other times, both reviewers and statisticians can help you to avoid embarrassing yourself.
