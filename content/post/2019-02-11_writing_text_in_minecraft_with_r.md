It's been nearly two years since I attended the [RopenSci UnConf
2017](https://kbroman.org/blog/2017/05/27/ropensci-unconf-2017/) in LA
and worked with [Gergely Dar√≥czi](https://github.com/daroczig),
[Brooke Anderson](https://github.com/geanders), [David
Smith](https://github.com/revodavid), [Mario
Inchiosa](https://github.com/inchiosa), and [Adi
Zaidi](https://github.com/akzaidi) to create the
[miner](https://github.com/kbroman/miner) package for interacting
with [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) from
[R](https://r-project.org). We spent a half-day writing the package
and then a day and a half playing, with a bunch of our ideas
implemented in the [craft](https://github.com/kbroman/craft)
package and illustrated in the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) book,
[R programming with
Minecraft](https://kbroman.org/miner_book).

I'd meant to follow up with a bunch more on the stuff we'd done, and
to really finish up and polish the book. But, well, I didn't. But I'm
going to try to do so now. I'll start by explaining how I was able to
write text in Minecraft, like this:

## My goal was to make a ggplot scatterplot

Once we had [miner](https://github.com/kbroman/miner) up and
running, the first thing I wanted to do was [render a picture out of
blocks](https://kbroman.org/miner_book/rendering-an-image-in-minecraft.html).
Specifically, I wanted to create a picture of
[Karthik](http://inundata.org) in Minecraft. And so I
did:

![Karthik in Minecraft](/images/karthik_minecraft.png)

My next goal was to make a `ggplot2::theme_gray()`-styled scatterplot
within Minecraft. Like, I wasn't so ambitious that I wanted to add a
`geom_minecraft()` or a ggplot2 Minecraft plugin, but I thought it'd
be cool to make an image of a ggplot2-style graph in Minecraft and
then pretend that I'd done it properly. If I can create an image in
Minecraft, then of course I can create a scatterplot. The only tricky
part would be the axis labels: being able to write text in Minecraft.

(I mean, you can probably guess that I first tried saving a graph to
an image file and then rendering that in Minecraft. But it looked
terrible because the points in the scatterplot wouldn't be captured
well, and the text in the axis labels was especially terrible.)

## Pixel-based fonts

It seemed like I just needed some old-style, pixelated fonts. You know,
like the ones used on LCD displays. It took a lot of googling, but I
finally found this [font
bitmaps](http://uzebox.org/wiki/index.php?title=Font_Bitmaps) page at
[uzebox.org](http://uzebox.org), which has a big list of font sizes,
and then for each font size there's a bunch of PNG images with
different fonts in that size. For example, here's the one I'm using
for the 6x8 font:

[![6x8 font bitmap](/images/Sebasic_charset_192w.png)](
http://uzebox.org/wiki/images/a/a2/Sebasic_charset_192w.png)

Yeah so that's great. I could see these images of the fonts, with the
available characters, but what I wanted was like a bitmap: for
example, for each character in a 6x8 font, I wanted 0s and 1s
indicating which bits need to be dark versus light.

Ugh, I spent a couple of hours googling and puzzling over this. Why
would they provide these images and not provide a bitmap, so that you
could actually make the font? I mean, the title of [that
page](http://uzebox.org/wiki/index.php?title=Font_Bitmaps) was "_Font
Bitmaps_"!

_Finally_ I realized that, just like the picture of Karthik that I
had made, the PNG images I was looking at _were_ the bitmaps. I could
load them into R with the
[imager](https://cran.r-project.org/package=imager) package and then
grab the 0s and 1s there. The only thing I needed to do was look at
the images and type in the sets of characters that were inside the
images. For example, for the 6x8 image above, the PNG file is 192 x 24
pixels: 24 pixels tall because there are three rows of characters and
they each are 8 characters tall, and 192 pixels wide because there are
32 columns of characters and they are each 6 pixels wide.

The script I used to set up the fonts is [hiding inside the craft
package](https://github.com/kbroman/craft/blob/master/inst/scripts/grab_fonts.R).

## Rendering text

For text I want to write in Minecraft, I first split it into
the individual characters. Then I convert each character into a
bitmap.

For each size font, we basically have a matrix of available characters
and then a matrix that is the font image bitmap. I find the character
in the font, and then pull out the corresponding chunk of the font
bitmap. I then paste those bitmaps back together, to get a bitmap for
the full text.

Finally, I render it in Minecraft by looping over the elements of the
bitmap matrix of 0s and 1s and adding a block wherever there's a 1,
using [`miner::setBlock()`](https://github.com/kbroman/miner/blob/master/R/setBlock.R).

## Rotating the text

The other tricky bit was figuring out which direction to draw the text. And
like, how many different directions can you draw text in 3d space?
Really, I have a terrible spatial sense. And I refuse to admit how
long it took me to work through that.

Suffice it to say, there are six directions in Minecraft: north,
south, east, west, up, and down. Your text could go in any of those
directions, but then for each such direction, the top of the text
could be oriented in one of four of the other possible directions. I
wrote an internal function
[`craft::check_dirtop()`](https://github.com/kbroman/craft/blob/master/R/write_text.R#L153-L164)
to check compatibility. (That's "check dir top" not "check dirt op", by
the way.)

And that was pretty much that. It doesn't seem like it was that hard,
but there were some important conceptual puzzles that took like 2/3 of
my time on this. In the end the code to grab the font information
is just about 80 lines, and the code to render text in Minecraft is
just about 160 lines. And it allowed me to do stuff like this:

_Update 2020-12-14_: the miner and craft packages and the miner book have been moved from
[ROpenSciLabs](https://github.com/ropenscilabs) to [kbroman](https://github.com/kbroman).
