I was flipping though the contents of [G3](http://g3journal.org) and saw [this paper](http://g3journal.org/content/2/9/1019.abstract), which includes [Jim Cheverud](https://www.luc.edu/biology/aboutus/facultyresearch/jamesmcheverud/) as an author.

I poked through the paper, and my eye was attracted to the following figure.  These are supposed to be functions, but some weird smoother was used, and the results are not functions.
