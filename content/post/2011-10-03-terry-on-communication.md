Relevant to [my recent comments on seminars](https://kbroman.org/blog/2011/09/29/seminars-bad-and-good/), Terry Speed's [latest commentary](http://bulletin.imstat.org/2011/09/terence%e2%80%99s-stuff-speaking-reading-writing/) in the IMS Bulletin focuses on communication (talks and papers).

He says: _read others' work_ (which I would expand to say, _pay attention_) and _practice_.
