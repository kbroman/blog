[Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/) is writing what will surely be a [great book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) about the basics of R packages. And [Hilary Parker](https://hilaryparker.com) wrote a [very](https://twitter.com/ErikaMudrak/status/504732734674444288) [influential](https://twitter.com/polesasunder/status/504785818922131456) [post on how to write an R package](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch). So it seems like that topic is well covered.

Nevertheless, I'd been thinking for some time that I should write another [minimal tutorial with an alliterative name](https://kbroman.org/blog/2014/02/06/knitr-in-a-knutshell-tutorial/), on how to turn R code into a package. And it does seem valuable to have a diversity of resources on such an important topic. (R packages are the best way to distribute R code, or just to keep track of your own personal R code, as part of a reproducible research process.)

So I'm going ahead with it, even though it doesn't seem necessary: the [R package primer](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer).

It's not completely done, but the [basic stuff is there](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer).
