I saw this great infographic at Andrew Gelman's blog:

[![MOST POPULAR INFOGRAPHICS](https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6190/6143338263_d2497c02fe.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smoy/6143338263/)

I'm inclined to [buy an art print](https://society6.com/albyantoniazzi/MOST-POPULAR-INFOGRAPHICS-You-can-find-around-the-Web_Print?show=promoters#user_list).

Note the relationship between the central panel and the cover of the latest [Amstat News](https://magazine.amstat.org/) (always a good source for embarrassing figures):
