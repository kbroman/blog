The New York Times has [an interesting interactive graphic](https://tinyurl.com/aqa9wum) on boys' and girls' average scores on a science exam, by country.

It's nice to see a scatterplot. (Often one would see just a bar plot, with female and male bars side-by-side.) Even better, this is an "[MA plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MA_plot)." That is, rather than just plot males vs females, they show the difference vs the average.

The wikipedia entry for [MA plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MA_plot) says such a plot of difference vs average is in medical statistics known as a [Bland-Altman plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bland-Altman_plot) and in other fields is known as a Tukey mean-difference plot.
