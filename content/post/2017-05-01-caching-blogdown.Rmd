[blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) is cool, but it seems
that it builds every `.Rmd` file every time you run `build_site()`, so
if your site includes an analysis that takes a while...well, every
time you build the site it's going to take a while.

I had the mistaken impression that blogdown would look at the
timestamps on the `.Rmd` and `.html` and only build the `.html` if the
`.Rmd` file is newer, but that's not true.

My [post about sqlite, feather, and fst](https://kbroman.org/blog/2017/04/30/sqlite-feather-and-fst/)
is rather slow, because I'm writing and reading rather big files and
measuring access times. So it was looking like building my
[new blog](https://kbroman.org/blog) would be really painful, forever
more.

Thus, I spent a bunch of time reworking the post to cache the times
rather than running things every time the `.Rmd` file was built.
[It's not pretty](https://github.com/kbroman/blog/blob/source/content/post/2017-04-30-sqlite-feather-and-fst.Rmd),
and my method is _not_ generally recommended, but it seems to work.

I expect [Yihui](https://yihui.name) has a better solution to this.
