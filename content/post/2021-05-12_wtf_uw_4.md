If you want an instant reaction from me, use the word "incentivize."
For example, "How can we _incentivize_ faculty to improve their
courses?" There’s a strong push to insert capitalism and competition
into everything we do.

If you've ever seen [faculty job interviews in action](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/globalhighered/faculty-job-interviews-gone-bad),
you likely agree that academics could use a bit of infusion of
professionalism or at least some training in how not to be an
asshole. But the drive to make universities more like businesses just
turns them into shitty corporations with values that have been twisted
away from what’s actually important.

When devoting resources to hiring new faculty, you might expect some
global assessment of what the biggest needs and opportunities are. But
no, we [hold a competition](https://facstaff.provost.wisc.edu/cluster-hiring-initiative/).
Oh, and we won't bother to ask about or consider educational needs.
Selected proposals will mostly hire faculty into Centers and
Institutes with little participation in the university's teaching
mission. This is all an effort to increase research funding.

The corporatization of UW-Madison has been relentness and
unappetizing. A growing proportion of emails were crafted by human
resources with little apparent understanding of the intended readers.
If only [google translate](https://translate.google.com) would include
"corporate" among the "translate from" options. And it's not just the
acronyms. For example, among the numerous and detailed emails about [COVID-related
furlough](https://hr.wisc.edu/covid19/furlough/#unemployment-benefits-during-furlough)
was the puzzling statement:

> For the upcoming Memorial Day holiday, employees on Campus-wide,
> Intermittent Furlough who take furlough days on both the Friday
> before and the Tuesday after Memorial Day will receive holiday pay.
> This is a change from recent communications and allows employees
> greater flexibility for holiday pay on Memorial Day.

I've [written before](https://kbroman.org/blog/2012/05/07/boring-us-to-submission/)
about my suspicion that the university administration uses corporate
language as a deliberate strategy to reduce faculty involvement.
Anyone eager to participate in the [human resources
redesign](https://www.hrdesign.wisc.edu/), or the [title and total
compensation
whatsit](https://hr.wisc.edu/title-and-total-compensation-study/)?

Also this figure, which _screams_ "shitty corporation," [broke me](https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/1228467586666582027):

I am aware of the use of the term _talent_ for television and movie
actors, but I was surprised to find that the
university has an office of [Talent Recruitment and
Engagement](https://hr.wisc.edu/about/talent-recruitment-and-engagement/)
plus an office of [Learning and Talent
Development](https://hr.wisc.edu/about/learning-and-talent-development/),
but maybe I'm just not a [fully engaged
employee](https://www.talent.wisc.edu/fullypreparedtoengage/).

Why does this corporatization of the university matter? In
assembling folks trained in corporate management of employees and
having them apply their training to university employees, it's not
just that we end up wasting time on "mission, vision, and values,"
or attempting to decode increasingly opaque emails.
Rather, it's that the university administration
separates itself from faculty and students and focuses on market
forces and satisfying our "clients." The market
doesn't reward good teaching. And learning can be painful, so making
students happy is often not the right goal.

I was appalled to read that the UW-Madison Chancellor, when asked about strengthening relationships with Black students, had told
students, "[That isn't my job, but that's someone else's
job.](https://theblackvoiceuw.org/2020/11/25/chancellor-blank-on-meeting-frequently-with-students-that-isnt-my-job/)"
Given the university's lack of diversity and the many racist
incidents on campus, we have a right to expect more direct
participation or at least a more politic response.
Show the students a bit of respect!

But back to _incentivize_.
The increasingly market-based focus of the university means that in a
discussion on how to improve our courses and curriculum, it's almost
certain that someone will raise the question, "How can we
_incentivize_ faculty to participate in this effort?" Because of
course we can't expect them to help their colleagues
and students without direct incentives.
