The UW Health nurses have been seeking recognition of their union. UW
Health claims that it cannot legally recognize their union, but
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul [issued an opinion](https://www.doj.state.wi.us/sites/default/files/news-media/6.2.22_AG_Opinion_Signed.pdf) that UW
Health **can** voluntarily recognize their union. Yesterday, the
nurses voted to hold a 3-day strike, Sept 13-15, 2022.
(See the articles in the [Wisconsin State Journal](https://madison.com/news/local/health-med-fit/uw-health-nurses-vote-to-authorize-3-day-strike-in-september-as-they-seek-to/article_505e594c-5669-5dd4-af58-7d9050fc2700.html) and the
