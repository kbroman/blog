It is shocking to me that [a statistics department](http://www.stat.wisc.edu) would offer a graduate-level statistical computing course only _every fourth year_.

I [had been arguing for a statistical programming course](https://kbroman.org/blog/2012/05/25/a-course-in-statistical-programming/): that we supplement the usual course on the _theory_ of statistical computing (numerical linear algebra, EM algorithm, MCMC, etc.) with a course on the _practice_ of statistical computing.

But I was assuming that the more theoretical statistical computing course was _actually being taught_.

If a department teaches a course at a frequency less than every-other-year, it's unavailable to many students, or it comes too late in their training to be useful. And statistical computing should really be considered part of a statistics department's _core curriculum_.

Update: As you might have anticipated, I've been asked to teach the course.
