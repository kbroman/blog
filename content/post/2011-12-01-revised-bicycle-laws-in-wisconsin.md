A newsletter from the [Madison B-Cycle](https://madison.bcycle.com/) folks pointed out that the biking laws in Wisconsin have been [revised somewhat](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/proposals/ab265), in interesting ways (at least to me).

  * You can now stick your arm out to the right to signal a right turn.  (I didn't realize that this was wrong.)

  * Studded bike tires (important for riding on snow and ice) are now legal.  (I didn't realize that they weren't.  I wish I'd had them when I crashed and broke my elbow back in 2008; now I don't need them as I'm not risking riding on snow in any case.)

  * You can have a rear light in place of a rear reflector. (Again, I didn't realize that this would be wrong.)
