I'm finally back to the story of the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/) logo.

I wrote [Part 1](https://kbroman.org/blog/2012/11/16/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-1/) in mid-November and [Part 2](https://kbroman.org/blog/2012/11/21/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-2/) a week later.  I said that Part 3 was "coming soon," but I've been a bit shy about revealing this.  You'll see why.

In August, 2005, [Ingo](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~iruczins/), [Greg](https://www.albany.edu/sph/19585.php), and I were sitting in a pub in Minneapolis in the early morning hours.  I think maybe [Brian](http://www.bcaffo.com) was there, too.  We had a session, which Ingo had organized, at the [Joint Statistical Meetings](https://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2005/) the next morning (really _that_ morning), and so we should have been sleeping.  ([Sunduz](https://sunduzkeles.org) was also in the session, but, sensibly, she wasn't out drinking with us.)  I think this was later in the evening on the night I'd offended the guy from Insightful when I said that anyone who still used Splus rather than R was an idiot.  And it was just after Greg and I (and perhaps Brian, if he was there) paid the waitress to _not_ bring the round of drinks that Ingo had ordered.

Of course, we were talking about the Hopkins SPH logo (otherwise, why would I be discussing this?) as well as an innovative alternative that Brian Caffo had devised, and Ingo bet me to include Brian's alternative logo in my talk the next day (or really _that_ day): If I included the alternative logo in my talk, he'd buy me beer for a month.

So, I did, though I had to stay up quite a bit later to get the images together.

[Christina](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kendzior/) and [Michael](https://www.stat.wisc.edu/~newton/) were in the back of the room.  Ingo was sitting in the front row.  We'd used Greg's laptop, so there was evidence.  I made a bit of fun of the Bloomberg name change, and I made a bit of fun of the logo, by showing the [Missionary Church](https://www.mcusa.org/Portals/8/Images/logo_251x130.gif) logo.  And then on my third slide, I paused for a bit and looked at Ingo, and he looked at me and then up at the screen, and when I saw that he'd seen it, I flipped to the next slide.

Here's Brian's alternative logo, next to the original.  Well, it's Brian's design but my rendering.

And [here's a PDF of the logos in context](https://kbroman.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/evidence.pdf).

And here's the month of beer:

Ingo was willing to restock if necessary, but that wasn't allowed.  We still have most of those coasters; they've been great toys for the kids.

In October that year, I used the alternative logo on the "[Wall of Wonder](https://www.jhsph.edu/offices-and-services/marketing-and-communications/policies/wall_of_wonder.html)" itself, on a second bet, with [Fernando](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3980/Pineda/Fernando_J.) this time.

I gave another of those informal statistics lectures, this time on "[What is regression?](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/regression_ho.pdf)"  Of course, they were pre-screening slides at that point, because of the [first such informal talk](https://kbroman.org/blog/2012/11/21/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-2).  But I gave them a last-minute substitution, with just the one logo change.

(I'm pretty sure that [Patty](https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/people/staff/hubbard.shtml) caught me, but she didn't turn me in.)

Here's the second month of beer:

It all seems a bit juvenile in retrospect.  I guess I'm getting (or _have gotten_) old.

_Update_: [Ingo](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~iruczins) says that "juvenile" is another word for "hip and dynamic," so I guess it's just that I'm no longer hip and dynamic.
