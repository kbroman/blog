<p>An odd thing happened to me on twitter today.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/uwsystem">UW System</a> had <a href="https://twitter.com/UWSystem/status/826167903145775104">tweeted a statement</a> from system president <a href="https://twitter.com/raywcross">Ray Cross</a> concerning Trump&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/trump-syrian-refugees.html">executive order</a> banning refugees and immigrants from 7 countries. Cross&rsquo;s statement is close to the most empty, useless possible such statement.</p>

<p>So I <a href="https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/826174494096109568">tweeted back</a>, asking him to revise his statement and actually take a stand against Trump&rsquo;s executive order.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/826174494096109568"><img src="https://kbroman.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/disappearedtweet.png" alt="disappearedtweet" /></a></p>

<p>Note that I mentioned not just <a href="https://twitter.com/raywcross">@RayWCross</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/uwsystem">@UWSystem</a>, but also <a href="https://twitter.com/potus">@POTUS</a>.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, the tweet had gotten a couple of ❤️&rsquo;s, and then one RT, but for some reason the tweet itself had disappeared from my twitter feed (in the app I use, <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a>). I looked at <a href="https://twitter.com/kwbroman">my twitter account</a> in a web browser, and sure enough the tweet wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>

<p>Puzzled, and knowing I hadn&rsquo;t deleted the tweet, I poked around and was able to find, somehow, the URL for the original tweet, and I could see <a href="https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/826174494096109568">the tweet</a> in a browser. So it hadn&rsquo;t been <em>deleted</em>, it had just been removed from my feed.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kerri_gilbert">@Kerri_Gilbert</a> then <a href="https://twitter.com/Kerri_Gilbert/status/826181462567297025">wrote</a> that she could see it in her feed but not if she went to my timeline. So I wasn&rsquo;t completely crazy.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/CFlensburg/">@CFlensburg</a> later <a href="https://twitter.com/CFlensburg/status/826231062460129280">wrote</a> that he could see the tweet, but <a href="https://twitter.com/CFlensburg/status/826232029549178880">he&rsquo;s in Australia</a>.</p>

<p>Now my hypothesis was: someone who looks after <a href="https://twitter.com/potus">@potus</a> had somehow suppressed my tweet. Or was I being paranoid?</p>

<p>A quick google search (for &ldquo;tweet disappeared from feed&rdquo;) revealed a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com">Washington Post</a> article from 2015-10-30, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/10/30/a-guide-to-why-some-activists-believe-their-tweets-are-being-censored-in-the-u-s/">Tweets are disappearing on Twitter. Why?</a>&rdquo; This seems to explain what happened: my tweet was suppressed by some kind of &ldquo;abuse filter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The article is an interesting read. It describes the experience of <a href="http://members.efn.org/~paulmd/">Paul Dietrich</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/paulmd199">@Paulmd199</a>), who wrote an analysis of his situation: &ldquo;<a href="http://members.efn.org/~paulmd/OwnWork/AdventuresinCensorship.pdf">Adventures in Twitter Censorship.</a>&rdquo; Also an interesting read.</p>

<p>And note that the tweet suppression is location-specific. It&rsquo;s okay for <a href="https://twitter.com/CFlensburg/">Australians</a> to read <a href="https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/826174494096109568">the tweet</a>, but Americans need to be protected from it.</p>

<h4 id="but-why-this-tweet">But why this tweet?</h4>

<p>This <a href="https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/826174494096109568">tweet of mine</a> was really a pretty bland tweet. I mean, I was directly criticizing my <a href="http://www.med.wisc.edu/about/administration/robert-golden-md/38">boss</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://chancellor.wisc.edu/about/">boss</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/raywcross">boss</a>, and we <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/education/university/regents-committee-passes-new-uw-madison-tenure-policy-with-changes/article_8249f119-05e7-5459-b4d8-25eab3e3882c.html">just barely have tenure at Wisconsin</a> anymore, so I certainly wasn&rsquo;t going to be abusive. I&rsquo;m not sure why I actually mentioned <a href="https://twitter.com/potus">@potus</a>, but I figured, &ldquo;What the hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But what sort of abuse detection algorithm would decide that <a href="https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/826174494096109568">this tweet</a> was abusive? If there&rsquo;s an abuse filter that would suppress <a href="https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/826174494096109568">this tweet</a> but not all of the actual abuse rampant on twitter&hellip;well that&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>

<p>Maybe it was that I wrote &ldquo;Sad.&rdquo; (I thought that was funny. And hardly abusive.)</p>

<p>I favor the theory that it wasn&rsquo;t an algorithm but rather a person: that someone is assigned to read all mentions of <a href="https://twitter.com/potus">@potus</a> and if they deem something inappropriate, they flip a switch and the tweet gets suppressed.</p>

<p>So maybe I <em>am</em> paranoid.</p>

<p>(I forgot to mention: <a href="https://twitter.com/nickfleisher">@NickFleisher</a> had the best response to <a href="https://twitter.com/UWSystem/status/826167903145775104">Ray Cross&rsquo;s lame statement</a>: &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/nickfleisher/status/826184115456143360">Revise and resubmit</a>.&ldquo;)</p>
