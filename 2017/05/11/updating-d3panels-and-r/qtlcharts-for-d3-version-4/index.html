    <h1 class="article-title">updating d3panels and R/qtlcharts for D3 version 4</h1>

    
    <span class="article-date">2017/05/11</span>
    

    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I just spent some time updating my <a href="http://kbroman.org/d3panels">d3panels</a> library and <a href="http://kbroman.org/qtlcharts">R/qtlcharts</a> package for <a href="https://d3js.org">D3</a> <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md">version 4</a>. It took just about a day, and the majority of the time was spent puzzling over <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#forces-d3-force">d3-force</a> and <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#brushes-d3-brush">d3-brush</a>.</p>
<p>(Note that I just barely know what I’m doing, by which I mean I <em>don’t</em> know what I’m doing. I’m able to get things to work, but I don’t always know why.)</p>
<p>I was very glad that I’d written a bunch of tests, because I could use those to figure out what was working and what was not working, and whether my changes were effective. <em>Tests, test, tests.</em> There’s nothing better than tests for this sort of refactoring business.</p>
<p>I like the changes in D3 version 4, but trying to figure them out feels a bit like being back in 2012, when I was first trying to understand D3: I’ve not found many tutorials that explain how to use the new version, so I mostly focused on reading the <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md">API documentation</a>, which isn’t easy for me to understand, or to walk through the code for some of [Michael Bostock]’s <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock">examples</a>. There are loads of books and tutorials on D3, but they’re almost all still talking about D3 version 3. (This will change shortly. For example, the 2nd edition of <a href="http://alignedleft.com/">Scott Murray</a>’s excellent <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920037316.do">Interactive Data Visualization for the Web</a> is at the printer, and covers D3 version 4.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ireneros.com/">Irene Ros</a>’s <a href="https://iros.github.io/d3-v4-whats-new/#1">slides on what’s new in D3 V4</a> were super helpful. (Also I just saw <a href="http://www.puzzlr.org/sample-page/">Tom Roth</a>’s nice <a href="http://www.puzzlr.org/force-graphs-with-d3/">tutorial on d3-force</a>, linked on the <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Tutorials">D3 tutorials page</a>; duh.)</p>
<p>My D3 code isn’t particularly fancy. (And note that I’m still writing in <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>; I toyed with the idea of switching to <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/">ES6</a>, particularly because we can now use <code>(d) =&gt; d.x</code>. But I love CoffeeScript and don’t want to lose list comprehensions, and actually my favorite thing is:</p>
<pre><code>some_option = chartOpts?.some_option ? the_default</code></pre>
<p>I do fight with the indentation at times, but I’ve grown accustomed to it.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the point of this: what did I have to change to get <a href="http://kbroman.org/d3panels">d3panels</a> and <a href="https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts">R/qtlcharts</a> to work with D3 version 4?</p>
<div id="simple-replacements" class="section level2">
<h2>Simple replacements</h2>
<p>The bulk of the changes were simple replacements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>d3.scale.linear()</code> → <code>d3.scaleLinear()</code></li>
<li><code>d3.svg.line()</code> → <code>d3.line()</code></li>
<li><code>d3.scale.category20().range()</code> → <code>d3.schemeCategory20</code></li>
<li><code>d3.random.normal(10,3)</code> → <code>d3.randomNormal(10,3)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Slightly more tricky: <code>d3.scale.ordinal().rangeBands([0,w],0,0)</code> became <code>d3.scaleBand().range([0,w])</code>.</p>
<p>Also, I had written (well, borrowed from somewhere) methods <code>.moveToFront()</code> and <code>.moveToBack()</code>, which I can omit as D3 version 4 has <code>.raise()</code> and <code>.lower()</code>.</p>
<p>So really, the majority of the changes were made by for <code>d3.</code>, making some tiny edit, and then seeing if my tests were working.</p>
</div>
<div id="d3-force" class="section level2">
<h2><a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#forces-d3-force">d3-force</a></h2>
<p>My D3 code is rather primitive. I’m basically just drawing and then adding some <code>.on(&quot;mouseover&quot;, something)</code> or <code>.on(&quot;click&quot;, something_else)</code> for interactivity.</p>
<p>But force-directed graphics are pretty awesome, particularly for <a href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/~eklund/beeswarm/">beeswarm</a>-type plots, so I did make use of <code>d3.layout.force</code> in two places.</p>
<p>But I didn’t really know what I was doing before, and that made the change to <code>d3.forceSimulation</code> a bit more puzzling. My <a href="https://github.com/kbroman/d3panels/blob/1.1.4/src/dotchart.coffee#L181-L246">code implementing a beeswarm-type dot chart</a> is really ugly and so not worth looking at or discussing. The <a href="https://github.com/kbroman/d3panels/blob/master/src/dotchart.coffee#L181-L201">new version</a> is just 21 lines (vs 65 lines before), and way easier to read.</p>
<p>For <a href="http://kbroman.org/d3panels/assets/test/dotchart/"><code>d3panels.dotchart</code></a>, the main bit looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>d3.range(scaledPoints.length).map( (i) -&gt;
    scaledPoints[i].fy = scaledPoints[i].y)

force = d3.forceSimulation(scaledPoints)
      .force(&quot;x&quot;, d3.forceX((d) -&gt; d.x))
      .force(&quot;collide&quot;, d3.forceCollide(pointsize*1.1))
      .on(&quot;tick&quot;, ticked)</code></pre>
<p>I have a data set <code>scaledPoints</code> which is an array of objects with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values for point locations. I add <code>.fy</code> to each element of the array, to prevent the <code>y</code> values from being changed. (This is a beeswarm-type chart where the x-axis is a category, and I want those values to be dynamically adjusted using <em>the force</em>, but the y-axis is the quantitative value, and I don’t want those values to change.)</p>
<p>Next I use <code>d3.forceSimulation</code>, pass in my data, and then add a force that makes the points want to go towards their x value another another force that makes them not collide with each other.</p>
<p>Finally, I have the <code>ticked</code> function that does the updating of the point locations.</p>
<pre><code>ticked = () -&gt;
    points.attr(&quot;cx&quot;, (d) -&gt; d.x)
          .attr(&quot;cy&quot;, (d) -&gt; d.y)</code></pre>
<p>And that’s that. There’s a bit more code since I want the option of having the opposite orientation, with the categories on the y-axis and the quantitative values on the x-axis, but really it’s just those 9 lines of code plus a couple of blank lines.</p>
<p>It was hard work figuring them out, but only because I was spending too much time hacking away without understanding, rather than trying to come to some understanding before doing any hacking.</p>
</div>
<div id="d3-brush" class="section level2">
<h2><a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#brushes-d3-brush">d3-brush</a></h2>
<p>The last major thing I had to figure out was d3-brush. I’ve not implemented any actual brushing in either <a href="http://kbroman.org/d3panels">d3panels</a> or <a href="http://kbroman.org/qtlcharts">R/qtlcharts</a>, but I did use <code>d3.svg.brush</code> in one my tests of <a href="http://kbroman.org/d3panels/assets/test/scatterplot/"><code>d3panels.scatterplot</code></a>, to show that it could be done.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://github.com/kbroman/d3panels/blob/1.1.4/test/scatterplot/test_scatterplot.coffee#L66-L99">original brush code</a>, which was applied for a matrix of three scatterplots, I was creating a separate brush for each of the three scatterplots. And with the old <code>d3.svg.brush()</code>, you’d pass x- and y-axis scales with <code>.x()</code> and <code>.y()</code>.</p>
<p>You don’t pass scales to the new <code>d3.brush()</code>. Instead, you use <code>d3.event.selection</code> to grab the current selection in screen coordinates and then have to convert them back to plot coordinates with your scales’ inverses.</p>
<p>But I revised my code to what I thought should be working, and which was actually working for the first of the three scatterplots, but I got cryptic errors if I tried to brush the other two scatterplots. And so finally, in the <a href="https://github.com/kbroman/d3panels/blob/master/test/scatterplot/test_scatterplot.coffee#L66-L102">revised code</a>, I decided to use a single brush that was applied across the three scatterplots. (It seems that you <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/ludwigschubert/0236fa8594c4b02711b2606a8f95f605">can implement multiple brushes</a>, but it’s complicated.) The single-brush solution is perfectly fine for my test case, and actually it’s maybe easier to understand.</p>
<p>So the conversion from <code>d3.svg.brush</code> to <code>d3.brush</code> was really pretty easy. I needed to abandon the multiple brushes, and then the back-calculation from screen coordinates to plot coordinates is slightly tedious but not a big deal.</p>
<p>So that was the last thing, and I now have both <a href="http://kbroman.org/d3panels">d3panels</a> and <a href="http://kbroman.org/qtlcharts">R/qtlcharts</a> working for <a href="https://d3js.org">D3</a> version 4.</p>
</div>
<div id="whats-the-point" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s the point?</h2>
<p>The point of all this is that I have ideas for further plots I want to make in <a href="http://kbroman.org/qtlcharts">R/qtlcharts</a>, such as a tool for exploring pleiotropy (that is, whether two traits are affected by a common genetic locus, or instead are each controlled by separate but closely linked loci). For that thing, I wanted a double-slider, and it seemed best to implement it using D3 version 4, <a href="https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3/d3doubleslider/">which I did</a>. But I want to use my slider with <a href="http://kbroman.org/d3panels">d3panels</a>, and really I want to incorporate it into <a href="http://kbroman.org/qtlcharts">R/qtlcharts</a>, so it was clear that I needed to spend some time refactoring.</p>
<p>And actually, I was surprised at how easy it was. (I thought it would be considerably more than a day’s work.) And I feel like I now kind of understand d3-force and d3-brush, so the effort involved was definitely worthwhile.</p>
