    <div class="article-content">
      


<p>I just spent some time updating my
<a href="https://kbroman.org/d3panels">d3panels</a> library and
<a href="https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts">R/qtlcharts</a> package for
<a href="https://d3js.org">D3</a> <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md">version
4</a>. It took just about a
day, and the majority of the time was spent puzzling over
<a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#forces-d3-force">d3-force</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#brushes-d3-brush">d3-brush</a>.</p>
<p>(Note that I just barely know what I’m doing, by which I mean I <em>don’t</em>
know what I’m doing. I’m able to get things to work, but I don’t
always know why.)</p>
<p>I was very glad that I’d written a bunch of tests, because I could use
those to figure out what was working and what was not working, and
whether my changes were effective. <em>Tests, test, tests.</em> There’s
nothing better than tests for this sort of refactoring business.</p>
<p>I like the changes in D3 version 4, but trying to figure them out
feels a bit like being back in 2012, when I was first trying to
understand D3: I’ve not found many tutorials that explain how to use
the new version, so I mostly focused on reading the <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md">API
documentation</a>, which
isn’t easy for me to understand, or to walk through the code for some
of [Michael Bostock]’s <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock">examples</a>. There
are loads of books and tutorials on D3, but they’re almost all still
talking about D3 version 3. (This will change shortly. For example,
the 2nd edition of <a href="https://alignedleft.com/">Scott Murray</a>’s
excellent <a href="https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920037316.do">Interactive Data Visualization for the
Web</a> is at the
printer, and covers D3 version 4.)</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ireneros">Irene Ros</a>’s <a href="https://iros.github.io/d3-v4-whats-new/#1">slides on what’s new in D3
V4</a> were super helpful.
(Also I just saw <a href="https://www.puzzlr.org/sample-page/">Tom Roth</a>’s
nice <a href="https://www.puzzlr.org/force-graphs-with-d3/">tutorial on
d3-force</a>, linked on the
<a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Tutorials">D3 tutorials page</a>; duh.)</p>
<p>My D3 code isn’t particularly fancy. (And note that I’m still writing
in <a href="https://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>; I toyed with the idea of
switching to <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/">ES6</a>,
particularly because we can now use <code>(d) =&gt; d.x</code>.
But I love CoffeeScript and don’t want to lose list comprehensions,
and actually my favorite thing is:</p>
<pre><code>some_option = chartOpts?.some_option ? the_default</code></pre>
<p>I do fight with the indentation at times, but I’ve grown accustomed to
it.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the point of this: what did I have to change to get
<a href="https://kbroman.org/d3panels">d3panels</a> and
<a href="https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts">R/qtlcharts</a> to work with D3 version
4?</p>
<div id="simple-replacements" class="section level2">
<h2>Simple replacements</h2>
<p>The bulk of the changes were simple replacements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>d3.scale.linear()</code> → <code>d3.scaleLinear()</code></li>
<li><code>d3.svg.line()</code> → <code>d3.line()</code></li>
<li><code>d3.scale.category20().range()</code> → <code>d3.schemeCategory20</code></li>
<li><code>d3.random.normal(10,3)</code> → <code>d3.randomNormal(10,3)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Slightly more tricky:
<code>d3.scale.ordinal().rangeBands([0,w],0,0)</code> became
<code>d3.scaleBand().range([0,w])</code>.</p>
<p>Also, I had written (well, borrowed from somewhere) methods
<code>.moveToFront()</code> and <code>.moveToBack()</code>, which I can omit as D3 version 4
has <code>.raise()</code> and <code>.lower()</code>.</p>
<p>So really, the majority of the changes were made by for <code>d3.</code>,
making some tiny edit, and then seeing if my tests were working.</p>
</div>
<div id="d3-force" class="section level2">
<h2><a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#forces-d3-force">d3-force</a></h2>
<p>My D3 code is rather primitive. I’m basically just drawing and then
adding some <code>.on(&quot;mouseover&quot;, something)</code> or <code>.on(&quot;click&quot;, something_else)</code> for interactivity.</p>
<p>But force-directed graphics are pretty awesome, particularly for
<a href="https://www.cbs.dtu.dk/~eklund/beeswarm/">beeswarm</a>-type plots, so I
did make use of <code>d3.layout.force</code> in two places.</p>
<p>But I didn’t really know what I was doing before, and that made the
change to <code>d3.forceSimulation</code> a bit more puzzling. My <a href="https://github.com/kbroman/d3panels/blob/1.1.4/src/dotchart.coffee#L181-L246">code
implementing a beeswarm-type dot
chart</a>
is really ugly and so not worth looking at or discussing. The <a href="https://github.com/kbroman/d3panels/blob/master/src/dotchart.coffee#L181-L201">new
version</a>
is just 21 lines (vs 65 lines before), and way easier to read.</p>
<p>For
<a href="https://kbroman.org/d3panels/assets/test/dotchart/"><code>d3panels.dotchart</code></a>,
the main bit looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>d3.range(scaledPoints.length).map( (i) -&gt;
    scaledPoints[i].fy = scaledPoints[i].y)

force = d3.forceSimulation(scaledPoints)
      .force(&quot;x&quot;, d3.forceX((d) -&gt; d.x))
      .force(&quot;collide&quot;, d3.forceCollide(pointsize*1.1))
      .on(&quot;tick&quot;, ticked)</code></pre>
<p>I have a data set <code>scaledPoints</code> which is an array of objects with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values for
point locations. I add <code>.fy</code> to each element of the array, to prevent the
<code>y</code> values from being changed. (This is a beeswarm-type chart
where the x-axis is a category, and I want those values to be
dynamically adjusted using <em>the force</em>, but the y-axis is the
quantitative value, and I don’t want those values to change.)</p>
<p>Next I use <code>d3.forceSimulation</code>, pass in my data, and then add a force
that makes the points want to go towards their x value another another
force that makes them not collide with each other.</p>
<p>Finally, I have the <code>ticked</code> function that does the updating of the
point locations.</p>
<pre><code>ticked = () -&gt;
    points.attr(&quot;cx&quot;, (d) -&gt; d.x)
          .attr(&quot;cy&quot;, (d) -&gt; d.y)</code></pre>
<p>And that’s that. There’s a bit more code since I want the option of
having the opposite orientation, with the categories on the y-axis and
the quantitative values on the x-axis, but really it’s just those 9
lines of code plus a couple of blank lines.</p>
<p>It was hard work figuring them out, but only because I was spending
too much time hacking away without understanding, rather than trying
to come to some understanding before doing any hacking.</p>
</div>
<div id="d3-brush" class="section level2">
<h2><a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#brushes-d3-brush">d3-brush</a></h2>
<p>The last major thing I had to figure out was d3-brush. I’ve not
implemented any actual brushing in either
<a href="https://kbroman.org/d3panels">d3panels</a> or
<a href="https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts">R/qtlcharts</a>, but I did use
<code>d3.svg.brush</code> in one my tests of
<a href="https://kbroman.org/d3panels/assets/test/scatterplot/"><code>d3panels.scatterplot</code></a>,
to show that it could be done.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://github.com/kbroman/d3panels/blob/1.1.4/test/scatterplot/test_scatterplot.coffee#L66-L99">original brush
code</a>,
which was applied for a matrix of three scatterplots, I was creating a
separate brush for each of the three scatterplots. And with the old
<code>d3.svg.brush()</code>, you’d pass x- and y-axis scales with <code>.x()</code> and
<code>.y()</code>.</p>
<p>You don’t pass scales to the new <code>d3.brush()</code>. Instead, you use
<code>d3.event.selection</code> to grab the current selection in screen
coordinates and then have to convert them back to plot coordinates
with your scales’ inverses.</p>
<p>But I revised my code to what I thought should be working, and which
was actually working for the first of the three scatterplots, but I
got cryptic errors if I tried to brush the other two scatterplots.
And so finally, in the <a href="https://github.com/kbroman/d3panels/blob/master/test/scatterplot/test_scatterplot.coffee#L66-L102">revised
code</a>,
I decided to use a single brush that was applied across the three
scatterplots. (It seems that you <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/ludwigschubert/0236fa8594c4b02711b2606a8f95f605">can implement multiple
brushes</a>,
but it’s complicated.) The single-brush solution is perfectly fine for
my test case, and actually it’s maybe easier to understand.</p>
<p>So the conversion from <code>d3.svg.brush</code> to <code>d3.brush</code> was really pretty
easy. I needed to abandon the multiple brushes, and then the
back-calculation from screen coordinates to plot coordinates is
slightly tedious but not a big deal.</p>
<p>So that was the last thing, and I now have both <a href="https://kbroman.org/d3panels">d3panels</a> and
<a href="https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts">R/qtlcharts</a> working for
<a href="https://d3js.org">D3</a> version 4.</p>
</div>
<div id="whats-the-point" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s the point?</h2>
<p>The point of all this is that I have ideas for further plots I want to
make in <a href="https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts">R/qtlcharts</a>, such as a tool
for exploring pleiotropy (that is, whether two traits are affected by
a common genetic locus, or instead are each controlled by separate but
closely linked loci). For that thing, I wanted a double-slider, and it
seemed best to implement it using D3 version 4, <a href="https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3/d3doubleslider/">which I
did</a>. But I
want to use my slider with <a href="https://kbroman.org/d3panels">d3panels</a>, and
really I want to incorporate it into
<a href="https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts">R/qtlcharts</a>, so it was clear that I
needed to spend some time refactoring.</p>
<p>And actually, I was surprised at how easy it was. (I thought it would
be considerably more than a day’s work.)
And I feel like I now kind of understand d3-force and d3-brush, so the
effort involved was definitely worthwhile.</p>
