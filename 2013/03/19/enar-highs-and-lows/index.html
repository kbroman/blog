    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I attended the <a href="http://www.enar.org/meetings">ENAR meeting</a> in Orlando, Florida, last week. (<a href="https://www.enar.org">ENAR</a> = &ldquo;Eastern North American Region&rdquo; of the <a href="https://www.biometricsociety.org">International Biometric Society</a>.)</p>
<p>I had a great time, but I did come to the strong realization that what I view as important is distinctly different from what the typical ENAR attendee views as important.  (<a href="https://rafalab.github.io">Rafa</a> said, incredulously, &ldquo;You knew that already!&quot;)</p>
<p>Let me tell you about the high- and lowlights, for me.</p>
<p>Also see the ENAR-related comments from <a href="https://yihui.name/en/2013/03/on-enar-or-statistical-meetings-in-general/">Yihui Xie</a> and <a href="https://alyssafrazee.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/ideas-for-super-awesome-conferences/">Alyssa Frazee</a>.</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Getting to know <a href="https://yihui.name">Yihui Xie</a>, and the introductory part of his talk on <a href="https://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having lunch with <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu">Hopkins Biostat</a> students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twittering, particularly with <a href="https://twitter.com/StrictlyStat">@StrictlyStat</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hspter">@hspter</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hadley Wickham&rsquo;s <a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org">ggplot2</a> tutorial, in which I really learned how to teach.  (Can I put it into practice?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu">Matthew Stephens</a>&rsquo;s talk, and spending time with him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://faculty.mdanderson.org/Jeffrey_Morris/Default.asp">Jeff Morris</a>&rsquo;s orientation to Epcot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The large data visualization session, with <a href="https://twitter.com/StrictlyStat">John</a>, <a href="http://hadley.nz">Hadley</a>, Amy Heineke, and <a href="https://kbroman.org">me</a>.  (Thanks, <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~bswihart/">Bruce</a>!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lowlights">Lowlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They should have emphasized the cheaper shuttle from the airport (vs taxi); the information was hard to find.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They should have emphasized that wifi was actually free; ignore the $14.95/day charge as it gets waived from your bill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registration on Sunday closed early, so many at the poster session were without name badges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program guide PDF should have had bookmarks, and the schedule should have included links to the abstracts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realism regarding the start time for the President&rsquo;s invited address.  But I guess if we knew the awards ceremony would take not 15 min but 45, <em>everyone</em> would skipped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The venue was too isolated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hotel was too expensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The $85 admission to Epcot was a required part of the registration fee (23%).  The registration fee ($365) was the same as for ENAR 2012 in Washington DC, but it could have been $280.  And there&rsquo;s a striking difference between &ldquo;It&rsquo;s free!&rdquo; and &ldquo;You already paid for it!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lighting in meeting rooms was not great.  We needed a ladder and a can of spray paint to &ldquo;turn off&rdquo; those lights shining on the screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As I said at the beginning, I had a good time. But I worry particularly about accessibility to students paying their own way.</p>
<p>It was a really useful and inspirational meeting, right up there with the <a href="https://kbroman.org/blog/2011/08/20/user-conference-2011-highlights/">UseR 2011 meeting</a> in the UK, but less from talks and more from individual interactions.</p>
