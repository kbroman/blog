      <p>I&rsquo;m finally back to the story of the <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/">Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</a> <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/identity/coreIdentity/logoIntro.shtml">logo</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://kbroman.org/blog/2012/11/16/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-1/">Part 1</a> in mid-November and <a href="http://kbroman.org/blog/2012/11/21/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-2/">Part 2</a> a week later.  I said that Part 3 was &ldquo;coming soon,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve been a bit shy about revealing this.  You&rsquo;ll see why.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>In August, 2005, <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~iruczins/">Ingo</a>, <a href="http://www.albany.edu/sph/19585.php">Greg</a>, and I were sitting in a pub in Minneapolis in the early morning hours.  I think maybe <a href="http://www.bcaffo.com">Brian</a> was there, too.  We had a session, which Ingo had organized, at the <a href="http://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2005/">Joint Statistical Meetings</a> the next morning (really <em>that</em> morning), and so we should have been sleeping.  (<a href="http://sunduzkeles.org">Sunduz</a> was also in the session, but, sensibly, she wasn&rsquo;t out drinking with us.)  I think this was later in the evening on the night I&rsquo;d offended the guy from Insightful when I said that anyone who still used Splus rather than R was an idiot.  And it was just after Greg and I (and perhaps Brian, if he was there) paid the waitress to <em>not</em> bring the round of drinks that Ingo had ordered.</p>

<p>Of course, we were talking about the Hopkins SPH logo (otherwise, why would I be discussing this?) as well as an innovative alternative that Brian Caffo had devised, and Ingo bet me to include Brian&rsquo;s alternative logo in my talk the next day (or really <em>that</em> day): If I included the alternative logo in my talk, he&rsquo;d buy me beer for a month.</p>

<p>So, I did, though I had to stay up quite a bit later to get the images together.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kendzior/">Christina</a> and <a href="http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~newton/">Michael</a> were in the back of the room.  Ingo was sitting in the front row.  We&rsquo;d used Greg&rsquo;s laptop, so there was evidence.  I made a bit of fun of the Bloomberg name change, and I made a bit of fun of the logo, by showing the <a href="http://www.mcusa.org/Portals/8/Images/logo_251x130.gif">Missionary Church</a> logo.  And then on my third slide, I paused for a bit and looked at Ingo, and he looked at me and then up at the screen, and when I saw that he&rsquo;d seen it, I flipped to the next slide.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s Brian&rsquo;s alternative logo, next to the original.  Well, it&rsquo;s Brian&rsquo;s design but my rendering.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://kbroman.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/evidence.pdf">here&rsquo;s a PDF of the logos in context</a>.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the month of beer:</p>

<p>Ingo was willing to restock if necessary, but that wasn&rsquo;t allowed.  We still have most of those coasters; they&rsquo;ve been great toys for the kids.</p>

<p>In October that year, I used the alternative logo on the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/offices-and-services/marketing-and-communications/policies/wall_of_wonder.html">Wall of Wonder</a>&rdquo; itself, on a second bet, with <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3980/Pineda/Fernando_J.">Fernando</a> this time.</p>

<p>I gave another of those informal statistics lectures, this time on &ldquo;<a href="http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/regression_ho.pdf">What is regression?</a>&rdquo;  Of course, they were pre-screening slides at that point, because of the <a href="http://kbroman.org/blog/2012/11/21/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-2">first such informal talk</a>.  But I gave them a last-minute substitution, with just the one logo change.</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;m pretty sure that <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/people/staff/hubbard.shtml">Patty</a> caught me, but she didn&rsquo;t turn me in.)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the second month of beer:</p>

<p><img src="http://kbroman.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/second_month_of_beer.jpg" alt="Second month of beer" /></p>

<p>It all seems a bit juvenile in retrospect.  I guess I&rsquo;m getting (or <em>have gotten</em>) old.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~iruczins">Ingo</a> says that &ldquo;juvenile&rdquo; is another word for &ldquo;hip and dynamic,&rdquo; so I guess it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m no longer hip and dynamic.</p>
