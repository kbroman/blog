    <h1 class="article-title">Towards making my own papers reproducible</h1>

    
    <span class="article-date">2013/03/10</span>
    

    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Much has been written about <a href="http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2011/01/01/scipolicyjan11/">reproducible research</a>: that scientific papers should be accompanied by the data and software sufficient to reproduce the results.  It&rsquo;s obviously a <em>Good Thing</em>.  But it can be hard to stick to this ideal in practice.</p>

<p>For my early papers, I&rsquo;m not sure I can find the materials anymore, and that&rsquo;s just 15 years back.</p>

<p>For my recent papers, I have developed a sort of system so that I can reproduce the results myself.  I use a combination tools, including <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a>, <a href="http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/">Sweave</a>, <a href="http://www.cpan.org">perl</a>, and, of course, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a>.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve not been distributing the detailed code behind my papers.  It&rsquo;s not always pretty, and it is not well documented.  (And &ldquo;not always&rdquo; is a bit of a stretch &ndash; more like &ldquo;seldom.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>When <a href="http://www.stodden.net">Victoria Stodden</a> visited Madison last fall, I was inspired to release this code, but I never carried through on that.</p>

<p>But then last night I <a href="https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/310633718551293953">twittered</a> an example graph from <a href="http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/publications/phyloqtl.pdf">a paper</a>, was (appropriately) <a href="https://twitter.com/fellgernon/status/310647658387734528">asked to produce code</a>, and so created a <a href="https://github.com/kbroman/phyloQTLpaper/">github repository</a> with the bulk of the code for that paper.</p>

<p>The repository is incomplete: it doesn&rsquo;t include the code to do the main analysis and simulations, but just to make the figures, starting from those results.  I&rsquo;ll work to add those additional details.</p>

<p>And, even once complete, it will be far from perfect.  The code is (or will be) there, but it would take a bit of work for an interested reader to figure out what it is doing, since much of it is undocumented and poorly written.</p>

<p>But if we ask for perfection, we&rsquo;ll get nothing.  If we ask for the minimal materials for reproducibility, we may get it.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s my goal: to focus first on <em>minimal accessibility</em> of the code and data behind a paper, even if it is minimally readable and so might take quite a bit of effort for someone else to follow.</p>

<p>One last point: I use local <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a> repositories for my draft analyses and for the whole process of writing a paper.  I could post that whole history, but <a href="http://kbroman.org/blog/2011/08/17/the-stupidest-r-code-ever/">as I said before</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Open source means everyone can see my stupid mistakes. Version control means everyone can see every stupid mistake I've ever made.</blockquote>

<p>It would be easy to make my working repository public, but it would include things like referees&rsquo; reports and my responses to them, as well as the gory details on all of the stupid things that I might do along the way to publication.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m more comfortable releasing just a snapshot of the final product.</p>
