    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I was playing Chutes &amp; Ladders with my four-year-old daughter yesterday, and I thought, &ldquo;How long is this going to take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw an <a href="https://datagenetics.com/blog/november12011/">interesting mathematical analysis of the game</a> a few years ago, but it seems to be offline, though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120819014527/http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/november12011/">you can read it</a> via the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">wayback machine</a>.</p>

<p>But that didn&rsquo;t answer my specific question, namely, &ldquo;How long is this going to take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I wrote a bit of <a href="https://gist.github.com/kbroman/5600209">R code to simulate the game</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the distribution of the number of spins to complete the game, by number of players:</p>

<p><img src="https://kbroman.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/chutes_and_ladders_spins1.png" alt="No. spins in chutes &amp; ladders" /></p>

<p>With two players, the average number of spins is 52, with a 90th percentile of 88.</p>

<p>If you add a third player, the average increases to 65, and the 90th percentile increases to 103.  You&rsquo;re playing fewer rounds, but each round is three times as long. If you add a fourth player, the average is 76 and the 90th percentile is 117.</p>

<p>So, in trying to minimize the agony, it seems best to not encourage my eight-year-old son to join us in the game.  If he plays with us, there&rsquo;s a 63% chance that it will take longer.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s particularly true because then the chance of my daughter winning drops from about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>That raises another question: if I let her go first, what advantage does that give her?  Not much.  The chance that the person who goes first will win is 50.9%, 34.4%, and 25.9%, respectively, when there are 2, 3, and 4 players.  So not a noticeable amount.  Thus I cheat (on her behalf). Really, though, I&rsquo;m cheating in order to shorten the game as much as to ensure that she wins.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: There&rsquo;s a close connection between this problem and my work on the multiple-strain recombinant inbred lines. (See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15545647">this</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22345609">that</a>.)  I&rsquo;m tempted to play around with it some more.</p>
