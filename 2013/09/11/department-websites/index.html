<p>I was thinking about department websites, partly because <a href="http://www.biostat.wisc.edu">my own department&rsquo;s website</a> is terrible, and recently a colleague asked me whether I could suggest some <em>good</em> department sites.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll describe the basic principles for a good department website, and then I&rsquo;ll comment on a number of examples.</p>

<p>But first: No discussion of academic web pages is complete without referring to the <a href="http://xkcd.com/773/">xkcd comic</a> on University websites, so let&rsquo;s start with that:</p>

<h3 id="basic-principles">Basic principles</h3>

<p>Here are what I see to be the basic principles for constructing a department website:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Think of the audiences and what they&rsquo;d be looking for</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Prospective students</p></li>

<li><p>Prospective/visiting faculty</p></li>

<li><p>Current students</p></li>

<li><p>Collaborators</p></li>

<li><p>Administrators</p></li>

<li><p>Current faculty</p></li>

<li><p>Department staff</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Keep the important stuff near the top; minimize bloat</p></li>

<li><p>Here&rsquo;s the key stuff that should be prominent:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Degree programs; courses; how to apply</p></li>

<li><p>Faculty and student pages</p></li>

<li><p>Staff contact information</p></li>

<li><p>Seminars</p></li>

<li><p>Job opportunities</p></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Don&rsquo;t use stock photos or (even worse!) clip art</p></li>

<li><p>Avoid deep nesting of information</p></li>

<li><p>Have meaningful URLs (in particular, don&rsquo;t let <a href="https://drupal.org/">drupal</a> use <code>node/134</code>)</p></li>

<li><p>Have a consistent style across the official pages &ndash; particularly in the location and layout of menus of hyperlinks</p></li>

<li><p>I prefer minimalism. Think <a href="http://www.google.com">google</a> or <a href="http://www.apple.com">apple</a> rather than <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="some-examples">Some examples</h3>

<p>I briefly perused a number of statistics and biostatistics department websites. Here are my first impressions. The sites for <a href="http://statistics.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley</a>, <a href="http://statistics.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a>, and <a href="http://www.stat.umn.edu/">Minnesota</a> Statistics were my favorites.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu">Hopkins Biostatistics</a></p>

<p>The key bits are half-way down the page, due to unnecessary (in my mind) school-related crap along the top, plus the news items. The &ldquo;Quick find&rdquo; looks-like-a-drop-down-menu at the top right seems to just link to a <em>different department&rsquo;s web page</em>. The news items at the top result in the menu moving upward when you click on a link (as those news items don&rsquo;t appear in the subsequent pages).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics">Harvard Biostatistics</a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s too much school-related crap at the top, but it&rsquo;s not as bad as the <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu">Hopkins site</a>. I like having pages &ldquo;For Prospective Students,&rdquo; &ldquo;For Current Students,&rdquo; etc., but they pop to pages that look totally different and lose that menu, so you have to go back and then forward again. &ldquo;Student Profiles&rdquo; maybe should just be called &ldquo;Student Profile&rdquo; as there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be more than one. The &ldquo;BIO&rdquo; in &ldquo;BIO Faculty&rdquo; and &ldquo;BIO Researchers&rdquo; was a little confusing: Is it obvious what &ldquo;BIO&rdquo; means, and is it really necessary?  I&rsquo;d put the Faculty and Researchers links closer to the top and may try to distinguish the different classes of links: the ones that people are really there for, and then all of the &ldquo;For Such-and-Such&rdquo; somewhat separately.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.biostat.washington.edu/">Washington Biostatistics</a></p>

<p>Reasonably clean, but a bit of the <code>node/134</code> problem. And there are two kinds of menus: tabs at the top, and a menu at the right side. I think it&rsquo;s okay, but it was a bit confusing initially: It wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious that I click a different tab to get a different set of menu choices.</p>

<p><a href="http://sph.unc.edu/department-pages/biostatistics/">UNC-Chapel Hill Biostatistics</a></p>

<p>The main page looks nice, but the sub-pages have a different format.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/">NC State Statistics</a></p>

<p>I generally like it, but why split the faculty list across multiple pages? I see no reason to limit the length of a web page; scrolling is our friend.</p>

<p><a href="http://sph.umn.edu/biostatistics/">Minnesota Biostatistics</a></p>

<p><em>Way</em> too much bloat at the top; links all over the place at the bottom</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stat.umn.edu/">Minnesota Statistics</a></p>

<p>I like this one. I&rsquo;m not sure about the color choices, but the site is clean, and it&rsquo;s easy to navigate. And I like the choice and order of topics in the menu at the left.</p>

<p><a href="http://statistics.stanford.edu/">Stanford Statistics</a></p>

<p>I really like this one: Just the facts, plus a picture of Sequoia Hall. There&rsquo;s a little menu bar at the top that has the key stuff. You want to know about courses or degree programs? Click &ldquo;Academics.&rdquo; You want to know about People or Seminars? They&rsquo;re right there at the top. How do you apply? Click &ldquo;Admissions.&rdquo; They could maybe trim the news on the left of the front page; some of it is getting old and at least one of the links doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.</p>

<p><a href="http://statistics.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Statistics</a></p>

<p>Berkeley is slightly better than Stanford. The websites, I mean. It&rsquo;s simple, there&rsquo;s a clean little menu at the top, and the menus at the top have clear little drop-down menus when you hover over things. I like that they use more horizontal space. I guess I wouldn&rsquo;t put &ldquo;Seminars&rdquo; under &ldquo;Research&rdquo; Nor would I put &ldquo;Alumni Connections&rdquo; under &ldquo;Industry.&rdquo; So there are ways in which Stanford is better than Berkeley.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sph.umich.edu/biostat/">Michigan Biostatistics</a></p>

<p>The front page looks a bit cluttered. And they list University rankings front and center, which is a bit of an embarrassment. There&rsquo;s a bit of school-related stuff at the top, but it&rsquo;s not as bothersome as some others. There may be too many choices on the left. It&rsquo;s hard to pick out the ones you want, even if they&rsquo;re there. And &ldquo;Students&rdquo; should really be &ldquo;For Students,&rdquo; while &ldquo;Careers&rdquo; should really be &ldquo;Alumni Profiles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, I could look at a ton more, but I&rsquo;m sort of sick of this. Go have a look yourself, and let me know if you find good ones.</p>
