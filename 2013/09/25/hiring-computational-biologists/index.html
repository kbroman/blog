<p>The <a href="https://morgridge.org">Morgridge Institute for Research</a> (MIR), a private research institute associated with UW-Madison, is looking to hire some computational folks working in biology. <a href="https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/About/Jobs/adPLV77619.pdf">One position</a> is joint with my department,  <a href="https://www.biostat.wisc.edu">Biostatistics &amp; Medical Informatics</a>.</p>

<h3 id="yet-another-symposium">Yet another symposium</h3>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, they held a symposium on &ldquo;Computation in Biology&rdquo; (<a href="https://kbroman.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/computation-in-biology-agenda.pdf">Here&rsquo;s the agenda.</a>) Great speakers: <a href="http://faculty.biomath.ucla.edu/msuchard/">Marc Suchard</a>, <a href="http://shoichetlab.compbio.ucsf.edu/">Brian Shoichet</a>, <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dpage/">David Page</a>, and <a href="https://hsci.harvard.edu/people/winston-hide-phd">Winston Hide</a>. They were asked to speak broadly about computation in biology and on the key issues for the future, and there was plenty of time for discussion.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what MIR was hoping to get out of the symposium, but if they were looking for guidance regarding their hiring efforts, it wasn&rsquo;t effective. At the beginning, the discussion was quite heated but not terribly constructive. In the middle, it became more like the usual sort of question/answer after a seminar. I must admit I didn&rsquo;t stay to the end. Perhaps some important insights were gained after I left. But it seems unlikely that the symposium provided much guidance about hiring in computational biology.</p>

<h3 id="the-key-issues">The key issues</h3>

<p>Here are what I think the key issues are, when a scientific organization is looking to hire some computational folks.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do you want a targeted search (for particular kinds of applications or approaches), or do you want to leave it general and just pick the best folks who apply?. (<em>In my experience, targeted searches don&rsquo;t work as well; you miss out on some great people.</em>)</p></li>

<li><p>What service role is expected of the person? Do you want them to meet some particular scientists&rsquo; needs, or are you going to let them do whatever they want, with the hope that they form useful (to the organization) collaborations? (<em>The expectations should be made explicit.</em>)</p></li>

<li><p>At promotion time, who is going to evaluate the person? If it&rsquo;s a separate academic department (say, Statistics, or maybe Biochemistry), do they share your organization&rsquo;s values? (<em>Some of the best applied computational scientists may not be generating the NIH grants that a traditional biological sciences department might expect, nor the JASA or Biometrics papers that a Statistics department might expect.</em>)</p></li>

<li><p>Will the person have appropriate mentors? Is there anyone at the institution who really understands the nature of their position and what they need to do to succeed? (<em>I worry particularly about computational scientists who are isolated from their computational peers.</em>)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have any great answers, but those are the issues that I&rsquo;m concerned about.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: The real point I&rsquo;m trying to make: academics doesn&rsquo;t do a good job of rewarding tool building (eg, software tools). It&rsquo;s often viewed as better to write papers with toy implementations than to make generally useful software. That&rsquo;s a real problem for computational biology, and for folks seeking to hire truly useful computational biologists.</p>
