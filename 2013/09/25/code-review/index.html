    <div class="article-content">
      <p>There was an <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/mozilla-plan-seeks-to-debug-scientific-code-1.13812">interesting news item</a> in Nature on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review">code review</a>.  It describes a project by some folks at Mozilla to review the code (well, really just 200-line snippets) from 6 selected papers in computational biology.</p>
<p>There are very brief quotes from <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/">Titus Brown</a> and <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/">Roger Peng</a>.  I expect that the author of the item, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/about/editors/index.html#ErikaCheckHayden">Erika Check Hayden</a>, spoke to Titus and Roger at length but could just include short bits from each, and so what they say probably doesn&rsquo;t fully (or much at all) characterize their view of the issue.</p>
<p>Titus is quoted as follows, in reference to another scientist who retracted five papers due to an error in his code:</p>

<p>Roger is quoted at the end, as follows:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I agree with both of them, but my initial reaction, from the beginning of the piece, was closer to Roger&rsquo;s: We often have a heck of time getting any code out of people; if we are too hard on people regarding the quality of their code, they might become even less willing to share.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we want people to produce good code:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>that works</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that&rsquo;s readable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that&rsquo;s reusable</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And it would be great if, for every bit of code, there was a second programmer who studied it, verified that it was doing the right thing, and offered suggestions for improvement.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, it seems really unlikely that journals have the resources to do this. And I worry that a study showing that much scientific software is crap will make people even less willing to share.</p>
<p>I would like to see the code associated with scientific articles made readily available, during the review process and beyond. But I don&rsquo;t think we (as a scientific community) want to enforce rigorous code review prior to publication.</p>
<p>Later, on twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown/status/382862626692149248">Titus took issue</a> with the &ldquo;not improve how it looks&rdquo; part of what Roger said:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Characterizing code review as strictly cosmetic was an unfortunate, gross simplification. (And how code looks <em>is</em> important.)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have enough time this morning to really clean up my thoughts on this issue, and I want to get this out and move on to reading that dissertation that I have to get through by tomorrow. So, let me summarize.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>We want scientific code to be <em>well written</em>: does what it&rsquo;s intended to do, readable, reusable.</p>
<p>We want scientific code to be <em>available</em>. (Otherwise we can&rsquo;t verify that it does what it&rsquo;s intended to do, or reuse it.)</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re too hard on people for writing substandard code, we&rsquo;ll discourage the availability. It&rsquo;s an important trade-off.</p>
