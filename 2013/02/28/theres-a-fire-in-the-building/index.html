      <p>I was at work this morning at 8am.  At 8:45am I got a text asking what was going on in <a href="https://www.map.wisc.edu/?initObj=bdg_MdScC">my building</a>, with this picture:</p>

<p>It was news to me.</p>
<p>At 8:55am we got an alert saying &ldquo;Avoid 1300 Univ Ave.  Fire and Police on scene for working fire.&rdquo;  Hey, I&rsquo;m at 1300 University Avenue!</p>
<p>We could see out the window that there was a campus police officer preventing people from entering the building.  But the fire alarm had never gone off.</p>
<p>At 9:05am I called the campus police to ask what was going on.  They said all the alarms were supposed to go off.  They asked me to leave the building.  I did immediately, but afterwards I wished I&rsquo;d brought my lunch and laptop with me.</p>
<p>Apparently no one was hurt, but there seems to be quite a mess.  This is on the same floor as my office, not too far away:</p>

<p>The fire seems to be around the corner from that shot, in the back-central part of the building.  I peaked around the corner and saw a bunch of people standing around, but I was too shy to take a picture of them.</p>
<p>There is a related article in the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ccyggdl">Wisconsin State Journal</a>.</p>
