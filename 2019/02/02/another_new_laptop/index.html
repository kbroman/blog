<p>I&rsquo;d long been a MacBook Pro user. I went through like 6 or 8 of them.
My favorites were the 17&rdquo; ones. Heavy, but that big screen was great
for data analysis, programming, and writing papers.</p>

<p>Mac OSX seemed designed just for me: unix minus the trouble, plus
Word. But it seems like Apple is now designing with someone totally
different in mind. I mean, my MacPro desktop is on its last legs but
hell if I&rsquo;m going to buy one of their new ones which are basically
like a laptop that you sit on your desk. I want to be able to open the
thing and slide hard drives and memory and graphics cards in and out.
And these latest MacBook Pros: still limited to 16 GB RAM and smallish
SSD drives, and no real escape key because of that damned touch bar.
And only USB-C ports. The new MacBook Air at least has a proper escape
key, but again just one kind of port.</p>

<h2 id="last-year-s-new-laptop">Last year&rsquo;s new laptop</h2>

<p>So a year ago, needing a new laptop, I bought a linux laptop from
<a href="https://system76.com">System76</a>. And in what turned out to be an
over-reaction of anti-Mac fervor, I got their <a href="https://system76.com/laptops/oryx">Oryx
Pro</a> monster, fully loading with a
15&rdquo; HiDPI screen with a NVIDIA GTX 1070 graphics card, 64 GB RAM, a 2
TB SSD and another 2 TB hard drive for backup and extra space. The
thing weighs 6.5 lbs (2.9 kb), but really not <em>that</em> much heavier than
my previous MacBook; just a bit thicker.</p>

<p>This thing has been a joy to work on. Beautiful screen, and all the RAM
and nearly the power of my desktop.
Oh and it has all of the ports. 3 USB-A, 2 USB-C, 2 mini display ports,
hdmi, ethernet, SD card.</p>

<p>And linux has been a dream. Managing ubuntu is nothing like
managing RedHat as I did back in 1999. Everything just works (except
for the screen mirroring with this particular machine). The occasional
installation woes are actually easier than on a Mac, I think because it&rsquo;s all
as intended rather being a homebrew
great-but-kind-of-hacky-outside-the-OS deal.</p>

<p>But, two important downsides. First, the battery really sucks. The
fan&rsquo;s going essentially all the time while I&rsquo;m working, and the battery
lasts only an hour for me, if that. So you essentially need
to have it plugged in all of the time. Which means you can&rsquo;t even use
it for the occasional meeting without lugging along the power adapter (which
weights 1.7 lbs ie 750 g) and being near an outlet.</p>

<p>Second, the HiDPI screen is awesome, but I&rsquo;ve still not figured out
how to mirror the screen when giving a presentation. I can use it to
show slides (provided I stay plugged in), but I can&rsquo;t use it for
teaching where I need to be able to demonstrate something in
<a href="https://rstudio.com">RStudio</a>. So I&rsquo;ve been teaching using a
chromebook, and at times in the last year I&rsquo;ve traveled with both my
laptop and a chromebook.</p>

<p>So really, the Oryx Pro is an awesome machine and I love it but it
just doesn&rsquo;t fit my traveling/teaching needs.</p>

<h2 id="so-yet-another-new-laptop">So yet another new laptop</h2>

<p>So I needed something new. I want power and RAM and ports, and I don&rsquo;t
care about weight, but I don&rsquo;t want to be completely tied to a power
outlet, and I want to be able to easily mirror to an LCD projector.</p>

<p>I looked at the Dell XPS 13 developer edition, but no more than 16 GB
RAM and just USB-C ports. If I wanted to run linux on a Mac-like
thing I would buy a Mac and run linux on it. And I don&rsquo;t want to touch
Lenovo.</p>

<p>So I decided to get another System76, the <a href="https://system76.com/laptops/galago">Galago
Pro</a>. I got the 14&rdquo; 1920x1080
screen (avoid the HiDPI because of the screen mirroring issue and
indeed this one works fine mirroring to an LCD projector). 32 GB RAM
(I&rsquo;ll miss the 64 GB but what can you do) and 2x 2 TB SSDs. And all the
ports I want: 2 USB-A, USB-C, mini display, hdmi, SD card, ethernet.</p>

<p>Reviews tend to mention that the battery sucks, but they&rsquo;re saying the
battery sucks because it only lasts 3-4 hours rather than the battery
sucks because it only lasts 30 minutes. Yeah 10 hour batteries are
great but I&rsquo;m okay with 3 hours if I can have proper ports. I just got
it yesterday, but working with it today I can tell that the battery
is sufficient for my needs.</p>

<p>The screen is a bit smaller than I want, and it&rsquo;s not so sharp as my
other, but I&rsquo;m fine with the 1080p and I think it&rsquo;s big and sharp
enough to code and write on.</p>

<p>Oh, and this laptop weighs 3 lbs 6 oz (1.5 kg), and the power adapter
is just 5 oz (150 g), so jointly like 3.6 lbs vs 8.1 lbs for the Oryx
Pro and adapter. But who cares about weight, really? I&rsquo;m all about RAM,
ports, SSDs, moderate battery, and easy projecting.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture of my Galago Pro, sitting on top of my Oryx Pro.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s a picture of the two power adapters.</p>
