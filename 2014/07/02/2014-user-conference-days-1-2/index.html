<p>I&rsquo;m at UCLA for the <a href="http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/">UseR Conference</a>. I attended <a href="http://kbroman.org/blog/2011/08/20/user-conference-2011-highlights/">once before</a>, and I really enjoyed it. And I&rsquo;m really enjoying this one. I&rsquo;m learning a ton, and I find the talks very inspiring.</p>

<p>In my comments below, I give short shrift to some speakers (largely by not having attended their talks), and I&rsquo;m critical in some places about the conference organization. Having <a href="http://www.rqtl.org/ctc2013/">co-organized a small conference last year</a>, I appreciate the difficulties. I think the organizers of this meeting have done a great job, but there are some ways it which it might have been better (e.g., no tiny rooms, a better time slot for the posters, and more space for the posters).</p>

<h3 id="day-1-tutorials">Day 1: Tutorials</h3>

<p>The first day was devoted to <a href="http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/#tutorials">tutorials</a>. I arrived later than intended and missed the morning tutorials and was just in time for the afternoon ones. But the tutorial I wanted to attend, [Ramnath Vaidyanathan&rsquo;s tutorial on interactive documents]() was in a tiny room that was already filled beyond capacity. And by the time I tried to switch, the others were well underway, and I&rsquo;d lost my momentum. Plus I was distracted by ice cream. And seeing <a href="http://yihui.name/en/">Yihui</a>, <a href="http://inundata.org/">Karthik</a>, <a href="http://hilaryparker.com/">Hilary</a>, and <a href="http://www.sandradgriffith.com/">Sandy</a>.</p>

<p>Materials for many of the tutorials are <a href="http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/#tutorials">online</a>; grab them while you can.</p>

<p>The evening reception was interesting. I listened in to <a href="https://github.com/jcheng5">Joe Chang</a> talking to <a href="http://www.talgalili.com/">Tal Galili</a> about the value of <a href="https://github.com/hadley/dplyr">dplyr</a> and <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html">magrittr</a>&rsquo;s pipe operator (<code>%&gt;%</code>) for data manipulation in R. Joe was quite persuasive: replace a nested series of function calls, to be read from the inside out, with a stream of pipes.</p>

<p>I was excited to meet <a href="http://scottchamberlain.info/">Scott Chamberlain</a> and to see <a href="http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/">Jenny Bryan</a> and <a href="http://www.vince.vu/">Vince Vu</a>, and of course <a href="http://had.co.nz/">Hadley</a>.</p>

<h3 id="day-2">Day 2</h3>

<h4 id="john-chambers">John Chambers</h4>

<p>The opening talk was by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chambers_(statistician)">John Chambers</a>. I&rsquo;d not heard him speak before. (Back in 2005, I think, at JSM in Minneapolis, I tried to attend a session with John Chambers, <a href="http://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/robert-gentleman">Robert Gentleman</a>, and <a href="http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~duncan/">Duncan Temple Lang</a>, on the future of statistical computing, but it was assigned a room for 30 people, and by the time I got there there was a mass of more than 30 people <em>outside</em> the room.)</p>

<p>John talked about the origin of S, including a <a href="https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/484005898965090305">handwritten &ldquo;viewgraph&rdquo;</a> from the first discussion of the idea in 1976. His basic point was that R was conceived not as a language but as an interface to algorithms: to make it easier to use Fortran-based routines for things like linear regression. And R continues to have much value in that regard:  user-friendly interfaces for statistical calculations.</p>

<p>He gave a shout out to <a href="http://www.rcpp.org/">Rcpp</a>, <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/Rllvm/">Rllvm</a>, and <a href="http://0xdata.com/">h2o</a></p>

<h4 id="interactive-graphics">Interactive graphics</h4>

<p>The first contributed session was on interactive graphics from R.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/wch">Winston Chang</a> introduced <a href="http://ggvis.rstudio.com/">ggvis</a>, which is an exciting effort at <a href="http://www.rstudio.com">RStudio</a> to make interactive graphics readily accessible from R.  It uses a ggplot2-style syntax, but with the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html">magrittr</a> pipe operator, and using <a href="https://github.com/trifacta/vega/">Vega</a> as the underlying engine.</p>

<p><a href="http://ramnathv.github.io/">Ramnath Vaidyanathan</a> spoke about <a href="http://rcharts.io/">rCharts</a>, which makes a huge list of javascript-based visualization libraries accessible from R using a lattice-style syntax. He went through a ton of great examples, pointed to a <a href="http://rcharts.io/gallery/">gallery of others</a>, and briefly describing the underlying strategy.</p>

<p>There were additional talks about <a href="https://plot.ly/">plotly</a> and <a href="http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/abstracts/talks/216_Subramaniam.pdf">iwPlot</a>.</p>

<p>plotly is an effort to make <a href="http://d3js.org">D3</a>-based graphs accessible from R (and python and matlab), as well as editable and collaborative. But I don&rsquo;t like plotly&rsquo;s <a href="https://plot.ly/tou">Terms of service</a>, nor that it&rsquo;s closed source. And the presentation was all demonstration with little exposition and so a bit hard to follow.</p>

<p>iwPlot is an effort to reimplement <a href="http://rforge.net/Acinonyx/">iPlot eXtreme</a> with web-based graphics, for interactive graphics with massive datasets, with everything &ldquo;in the cloud&rdquo; rather than on a desktop. I was surprised that they&rsquo;re writing everything from scratch rather than make use of other javascript-based libraries. And the examples weren&rsquo;t very compelling. I was excited about iplot eXtreme back in 2011, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have progressed much since. Its <a href="http://rforge.net/Acinonyx/">web site</a> says &ldquo;An official release on CRAN is expected in Sept 2011,&rdquo; but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to have happened.</p>

<h4 id="web-integration">Web/integration</h4>

<p>I skipped a couple of important talks in here: on <a href="http://rcloud.persistent.com/rCloud">RCloud</a> and <a href="https://www.opencpu.org/">OpenCPU</a>. I needed a walk and an espresso.</p>

<p>I was back for <a href="https://github.com/jcheng5">Joe Cheng</a>&rsquo;s talk about <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a>, for making interactive web applications with R, with no requirement of knowledge of html, css, or javascript. It was really well presented; especially cool is the ability to include shiny apps within R Markdown documents, which is apparently even easier than creating stand-alone shiny apps.</p>

<p>And then <a href="http://inundata.org/">Karthik Ram</a> gave a great talk about <a href="http://ropensci.org/">rOpenSci</a>, to foster open science: a large set of packages providing access to a variety of data sources.</p>

<h4 id="martin-machler">Martin Machler</h4>

<p><a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/people/maechler">Martin Machler</a> gave a superb talk on &ldquo;Good practices for R programming,&rdquo; including seven principles:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Work with source files (rather than just typing in the console)</p></li>

<li><p>Keep R source readable and maintainable</p></li>

<li><p>Read the documentation</p></li>

<li><p>Learn from the masters (read others&rsquo; code)</p></li>

<li><p>Do not copy and paste (write functions)</p></li>

<li><p>Strive for clarity and simplicity</p></li>

<li><p>Test your code</p></li>
</ol>

<p>He made a number of further points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Leave optimization to later, clear code is more important than optimized code, and if you <em>do</em> optimize, measure rather than guess about speed.</p></li>

<li><p>Write packages</p></li>

<li><p>Use version control</p></li>

<li><p><code>R CMD BATCH</code> should work on your R script.</p></li>

<li><p>Never use <code>.RData</code>; your code should do all of the work. But use <code>save</code> for big computations and then <code>attach</code>. (Later he clarified, don&rsquo;t use <code>attach</code> with data frames, but do use it with <code>RData</code> files.)</p></li>

<li><p>Make use of the <code>log</code> argument to density functions, to avoid underflow, and use functions like <code>log1p</code>, for accuracy.</p></li>

<li><p>Use <code>drop=FALSE</code> when subsetting a matrix, so that the outcome remains a matrix.</p></li>

<li><p>Use <code>is.na(x)</code> not <code>x == NA</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Don&rsquo;t use <code>1:n</code> when <code>n</code> is not a positive integer.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="data-manipulation">Data manipulation</h4>

<p><a href="http://had.co.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a> gave a persuasive and instructive talk on <a href="https://github.com/hadley/dplyr">dplyr</a> and <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html">magrittr</a>&rsquo;s pipe operator, for data manipulation tasks in R. <a href="https://github.com/jcheng5">Joe Cheng</a> had largely convinced me the night before, but now I&rsquo;m thoroughly convinced of the value of these tools. The bottlenecks in analysis tasks are thinking, coding, and doing. For data manipulation, dplyr helps with the <em>thinking</em> part, by having you focus on a set of basic operations: filter, select, arrange, mutate, summarize, and &ldquo;group by,&rdquo; and then also the left join, right join, semi-join, and anti-join. Magrittr&rsquo;s pipe operator (%&gt;%) helps with the <em>coding</em>: you create a stream of pipes rather than a nasty mess of nested function calls that need to be read from the inside out. And <a href="http://www.rcpp.org/">Rcpp</a> helps with the <em>doing</em>: dplyr is super-fast (though not quite as fast as <a href="http://datatable.r-forge.r-project.org/">data.table</a>). Further, dplyr takes advantage of R&rsquo;s &ldquo;non-standard evaluation&rdquo; in a way that makes it easy to connect to external data sources, like databases, as if they were regular objects.</p>

<p>I skipped the rest of the session, though I should have at least stayed for the Matt Dowle&rsquo;s presentation on <a href="http://datatable.r-forge.r-project.org/">data.table</a>. (I understand that <a href="https://twitter.com/_inundata/status/484120526021881858">he could have an alternate career as a leader of group meditations</a>.) I&rsquo;ve just found that I have to limit myself. But <a href="https://twitter.com/timtriche/status/484120355254980608">a tweet</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/timtriche">Tim Triche</a> had a photo of a slide that showed the speed of data.table&rsquo;s <code>fread</code> function over R&rsquo;s <code>read.csv</code>. I need to adopt <code>fread</code>!</p>

<h4 id="posters">Posters</h4>

<p>The poster sessions were a tragedy. Seriously.</p>

<p>First, it was immediately after a long session (well, for those who stuck it through), and at the slot <a href="https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/484131994708627456">where one would want to eat dinner</a>. (Martin&rsquo;s talk was 3-4, the 3rd contributed session was 4-5:30, the posters were 5:30-7, and two panel sessions/mixers were 6:30-9.)</p>

<p>Second, the posters were arranged along a narrow hallway, and not on the walls but on stands which stuck out into the hallway. There really was no room for people to view the things.</p>

<p>It was too frustrating. I left to eat dinner.</p>

<h4 id="her-panel">heR panel</h4>

<p>It was great that the meeting included a well-attended <a href="https://github.com/skoval/her2014">panel discussion and mixer</a> to discuss how to encourage more women R users. But I was a bit disappointed with the event.</p>

<p>We can all agree that women are underrepresented as contributors of packages to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> and as participants in R conferences. But why? And how to change this? I didn&rsquo;t gain much insight.</p>

<p>I think I just don&rsquo;t like panel discussion. The five women on the panel, and the moderator, are admirable and their views interesting. But they don&rsquo;t have a unique understanding of the problem or solutions. I think I would have preferred a more open discussion, to hear much more from all of the other women in the room.</p>

<p>I felt the same way about the panel discussion at <a href="http://www.rqtl.org/ctc2013">the meeting I co-organized in 2013</a>: I would have preferred to have heard much more from the general audience and less from the panel.</p>

<p>The most shocking revelation concerned the unnecessarily extensive effort that <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~amelia.mcnamara/">Amelia McNamara</a> had to expend in order to include a <em>harrassment policy</em> on the <a href="http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/">meeting web site</a>. The value of such a policy should be obvious from the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_incidents">history of bad behavior</a> at scientific and technical conferences.</p>

<p>I would have been happier had the discussion continued for another hour. The audience was just getting going when the event ended.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that there are a lot more women R users out there, but they aren&rsquo;t contributing R packages because it has long been a very cumbersome process. (But see <a href="http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/">Hilary Parker&rsquo;s tutorial</a>.) And they don&rsquo;t necessarily identify as &ldquo;R users&rdquo; but rather as more general applied statisticians. And they&rsquo;ve not yet learned of the great value in attending UseR conferences, for learning and networking.</p>

<h4 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>UseR conferences are fabulous: for inspiration, learning, and networking. They&rsquo;re not for gurus, but for normal people who want to share ideas and learn about new and exciting developments. (The next <a href="http://user2015.org">UseR meeting</a> will be June 30-July 3, 2015, in Aalborg, Denmark.)</p></li>

<li><p>The smallest meeting room shouldn&rsquo;t be very small.</p></li>

<li><p>Poster sessions need a proper time slot, and they need a lot of space.</p></li>

<li><p>I don&rsquo;t much like panel discussions but rather prefer more open discussions.</p></li>

<li><p>I need to adopt <a href="https://github.com/hadley/dplyr">dplyr</a> and <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html">magrittr</a> immediately. Also <a href="http://datatable.r-forge.r-project.org/">data.table</a>&rsquo;s <code>fread</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>I need to learn <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com">shiny</a>, <a href="http://ggvis.rstudio.com">ggvis</a>, <a href="http://rcharts.io">rCharts</a>, and some of the <a href="http://ropensci.org">rOpenSci</a> packages (and <a href="http://ggplot2.org">ggplot2</a> for that matter; I still just use base graphics), at least so that I can get students using them.</p></li>
