<p>A certain photo of me has been following me around for some time.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/pictures/moustache.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="caption">Karl with a mustache, 15 Nov 2002</p>

<p>The thing is <a href="https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/pictures/moustache.jpg">sitting on my website</a>, so I suppose I have only myself to blame. I actually quite like the photo. I look happy. I <em>was</em> happy. I&rsquo;m not always happy.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>It&rsquo;s shown up in a lot of talks, particularly by <a href="https://rafalab.github.io">a certain friend of mine</a>.</p>

<p>It <a href="https://twitter.com/StrictlyStat/status/495240349225607169">appeared on the seminar board</a> at <a href="https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu">Hopkins Biostat</a> earlier this month. Perhaps it&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/simplystats/status/505066800842047488">still there</a>. (<a href="https://twitter.com/simplystats/status/505066800842047488">My own innocent comments</a> prompt some of this.)</p>

<p><a href="https://hilaryparker.com">Hilary Parker</a> confirmed:</p>

<p>It seems time to tell the story behind the photo. This will probably be longer than it should be. But I&rsquo;ve included photos of cats.</p>

<h3 id="movember">Movember</h3>

<p>I think November, 2002, was the first time that a group of young <a href="https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu">Hopkins Biostat</a> faculty participated in the <a href="https://us.movember.com/">Movember Campaign</a>, in which guys shave and then grow a mustache (or moustache) for a month.</p>

<p>For various reasons, I didn&rsquo;t actually participate. Among the least important: I had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Dyke_beard">Van Dyke</a> at the time. It probably took me a couple of months to grow the thing, so damned if I was going to shave it off.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/pictures/van_dyke.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="caption">Karl with a Van Dyke beard (playing with Francis), 10 Nov 2002</p>

<p>(There was a big controversy during the competition. <a href="https://rafalab.github.io">Rafa</a> was growing an impressive handlebar mustache, but it was revealed that on weekends or when traveling, he&rsquo;d grow out the bit on his chin, so that it wouldn&rsquo;t be a proper mustache anymore. I believe he was disqualified.)</p>

<h3 id="a-beard-trimming-incident">A beard-trimming incident</h3>

<p>Now, I thought the whole <a href="https://us.movember.com/">Movember</a> thing went from Nov 1 to Nov 30. But this photo was taken 15 Nov 2002, and I recall that it was the last day of this <a href="https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu">Hopkins Biostat</a> competition. Actually, if you look at the <a href="https://us.movember.com/about/history#2003">history of Movember</a>, it seems that <em>they</em> started in 2003, so the Hopkins guys were ahead of their time. (And surely it was <a href="http://www.bcaffo.com/">Brian</a> who was responsible for this? As I recall, he was trying to introduce some Florida traditions, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_bogging">mud bogging</a> was viewed to be infeasible.) So maybe we went from Oct 15 to Nov 15?</p>

<p>Anyway, it was the morning of 15 Nov 2002, and I had a bit of an accident with my beard trimmer – I forgot to use the guard or some such. And so I shaved off a big patch of the beard part. Well, it was the last day of the mustache competition, so I figured what the heck, I&rsquo;ll shave it all off, except for the mustache. I think I was made an honorary participant.</p>

<h3 id="jhsph-happy-hour">JHSPH Happy Hour</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biochemistry-and-molecular-biology/">Biochemistry</a> graduate students organize a Happy Hour every Friday at the <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu">Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</a>. The <a href="https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu">Biostat Faculty</a> were enthusiastic participants. (As you may recall, Happy Hour was featured in the whole JHSPH logo saga; see parts <a href="https://kbroman.org/blog/2012/11/16/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-1/">one</a>, <a href="https://kbroman.org/blog/2012/11/21/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-2/">two</a>, and <a href="https://kbroman.org/blog/2013/03/06/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-3-karls-revenge/">three</a>).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/pictures/moustache">The photo</a> was taken at Happy Hour. So that&rsquo;s why I was happy. (There exists a dual photo of <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~jmcgread/">John McGready</a>, who was a true participant in the competition. But, as I recall, it&rsquo;s hard to detect the presence of a mustache in the photo of John, so it&rsquo;s not gotten the same play.)</p>

<h3 id="wilmer-dinner">Wilmer dinner</h3>

<p>You may ask, &ldquo;But why were you wearing a proper shirt and a sport coat? This was long after that incident with the Dean, where you were subsequently required to wear a proper shirt on a daily basis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, my wife worked at the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/wilmer/">Wilmer Eye Institute</a>, and we were going straight from Happy Hour to dinner with a group of her colleagues. I think it was in honor of some important visitor.</p>

<p>Why bring this up? Well, at the dinner, I was sitting next to <a href="https://webapps.jhu.edu/namedprofessorships/professorshipdetail.cfm?professorshipID=145">Oliver Shein</a>, and for reasons that I suspect you can infer quite well yourself, I was unusually exuberant, and I was telling him about the mustache competition. He asked me, &ldquo;Is there a prize for the winner?&rdquo; And I responded, &ldquo;A really bad mustache!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was then that I realized the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/0002003/oliver-schein">Oliver Shein is a mustache guy</a>. Oops.</p>

<h3 id="the-mustache-didn-t-last-long">The mustache didn&rsquo;t last long</h3>

<p>It seems like people think I was a mustache guy myself, from that photo. But it actually lasted just the one day.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-really-shocking-about-the-photo">What&rsquo;s really shocking about the photo</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why my Hopkins friends are so fascinated by the photo. Possible explanations include</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the mustache</p></li>

<li><p>that I look happy</p></li>

<li><p>that I&rsquo;m wearing a shirt with a collar</p></li>

<li><p>that I&rsquo;m wearing <em>a sport jacket</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m just glad to have people thinking of me, even if I&rsquo;m not entire sure what they&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
