    <div class="article-content">
      <p>In 2009, <a href="http://www.epibiostat.ucsf.edu/biostat/sen/">Åšaunak Sen</a> and I wrote a <a href="http://www.rqtl.org">book</a> about QTL mapping and the <a href="http://www.rqtl.org">R/qtl</a> software. We started working on it in the fall of 2006, and it was a heck of a lot of work.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d talked to several publishers, and ended up publishing with <a href="http://www.springer.com">Springer</a>. John Kimmel was the editor we worked with; I like John, and I felt that Springer (or <em>John</em>) did a good job of keeping prices reasonable. We were able to publish in full color with a list price of \$99, so that on Amazon it was about \$65. (In April, 2013, there was a brief period where <a href="https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/321747087744184320">it was just \$42 at Amazon</a>!)</p>

<p>Springer did arrange several rounds of reviews; they typically pay reviewers \$100 or a few books. But the copy editing was terrible (at the very least, you want a copy editor to <em>read</em> the book, and it was pretty clear that our copy editor <em>hadn&rsquo;t</em>), and the actual type-setting and construction of the index was left to us, the authors.</p>

<p>It feels nice to have written a proper book, but I don&rsquo;t think it makes that big of a difference, for me or for readers.</p>

<p>And John Kimmel has since left Springer to go to Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC, and Springer has raised the price of our book to <a href="http://www.springer.com/life+sciences/systems+biology+and+bioinformatics/book/978-0-387-92124-2">\$169</a>, so it&rsquo;s now selling for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0387921249/7210-20">\$130 at Amazon</a>. I think that&rsquo;s <em>obnoxious</em>. It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;ve gone back and printed extra copies, so it&rsquo;s hard to see how their costs could have gone up. But in the publishing agreement we signed, we gave Springer full rights to set the price of the book.</p>

<p>(<strong>Update</strong>: it&rsquo;s now listed at \$199, though it&rsquo;s still about \$130 at Amazon.)</p>

<p>I have a hard time recommending the book at that price; I&rsquo;m tempted to help people find pirated PDFs online. (And seriously, if you can&rsquo;t find a pirated copy, you should work on your internet skills.)</p>

<p>I corresponded with an editor at Springer, on why our book has become so expensive and whether there&rsquo;s anything we can do about it. They responded</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If we do a new edition, it could be listed as \$129.</p></li>

<li><p>If the book is adopted by university classes, &ldquo;the pricing grid it is based on would have lower prices.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Our book is available electronically, for purchase by chapter as well.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Purchase by chapter? Yeah, for <a href="http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-92125-9">\$30 per chapter!</a></p>

<p>Springer has <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/">published books and allowed the authors to post a PDF</a>, but only for really big sellers, and ours is definitely not in that category.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m both disgusted and embarrassed by this situation. If I could do it all over again, I&rsquo;d self-publish: post everything on the web, and arrange some way for folks to have it printed cheaply.</p>
