      <description>There was an interesting article in the New York Times several weeks ago about helmets and bike sharing programs: That cities are giving up on encouraging people to wear helmets as that will just discourage people from biking. One point that&amp;rsquo;s made is that promotion of helmets suggests &amp;ldquo;a sense of danger that just isn&amp;rsquo;t justified.&amp;rdquo; And, of course, there&amp;rsquo;s discussion of the higher frequency of biking and lower frequency of helmet-wearing in Europe.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure you won&amp;rsquo;t find a street sign like this in Baltimore:
It&amp;rsquo;s on my usual commute to campus.</description>

      <title>Revised bicycle laws in Wisconsin</title>
      <link>https://kbroman.org/blog/2011/12/01/revised-bicycle-laws-in-wisconsin/</link>

      <description>A newsletter from the Madison B-Cycle folks pointed out that the biking laws in Wisconsin have been revised somewhat, in interesting ways (at least to me).
 You can now stick your arm out to the right to signal a right turn. (I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that this was wrong.)  Studded bike tires (important for riding on snow and ice) are now legal. (I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that they weren&amp;rsquo;t. I wish I&amp;rsquo;d had them when I crashed and broke my elbow back in 2008; now I don&amp;rsquo;t need them as I&amp;rsquo;m not risking riding on snow in any case.</description>

      <title>SUV-driving bastards</title>

      <description>On my bike ride to work, in the rain, I was stopped at stop light, in the bike lane, when a big black SUV pulled up behind me and honked, wanting to turn right. Three seconds later the light turned green. As the guy turned behind me, he yelled out his window, &amp;ldquo;Get the hell out of the way!&amp;rdquo;
Who would not flip him off?
Madison can be great for biking, but it is not without assholes, though I suppose that is obvious.</description>
