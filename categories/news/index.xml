      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d long been a MacBook Pro user. I went through like 6 or 8 of them. My favorites were the 17&amp;quot; ones. Heavy, but that big screen was great for data analysis, programming, and writing papers.
Mac OSX seemed designed just for me: unix minus the trouble, plus Word. But it seems like Apple is now designing with someone totally different in mind. I mean, my MacPro desktop is on its last legs but hell if I&amp;rsquo;m going to buy one of their new ones which are basically like a laptop that you sit on your desk.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back from the ROpenSci Unconference in LA. A fabulous two days of R programming and, ur, playing Minecraft. As one does.
This was ROpenSci&amp;rsquo;s 4th unconference; the first I could attend. There were like 70 participants, nearly double what they had last year. The scheme is that people break up into groups and work on different projects that might be useful to the ROpenSci community. There was discussion about potential projects in advance on GitHub, and then the first morning we voted on what we were interested in doing via stickers:</description>

      <description>This is the new site for my blog; source at github.
I’m going to leave my old wordpress site as it is and not try to figure out how to move things over.
I’m not been writing much recently, in part because Wordpress is such a drag to work with. The present site uses blogdown, which is a joy. See the bookdown-based documentation (currently a bit thin) plus Amber Thomas’s tutorial and the examples at github.</description>

      <description>An odd thing happened to me on twitter today.
UW System had tweeted a statement from system president Ray Cross concerning Trump&amp;rsquo;s executive order banning refugees and immigrants from 7 countries. Cross&amp;rsquo;s statement is close to the most empty, useless possible such statement.
So I tweeted back, asking him to revise his statement and actually take a stand against Trump&amp;rsquo;s executive order.

Note that I mentioned not just @RayWCross and @UWSystem, but also @POTUS.</description>

      <description>The Daily Cardinal reports that there were no overhead sprinklers in the area of the fire yesterday. Fire fighters thought that sprinklers had gone off, but it was really a broken water pipe.
And there are no sprinklers in my office, either. I thought they were required, but I guess only in new construction.
There&amp;rsquo;s a short TV report (after a commercial) at the channel 15 site.
A graduate student interviewed said, &amp;ldquo;I have multiple copies of my data, but they&amp;rsquo;re all in that building.</description>

      <description>I was at work this morning at 8am. At 8:45am I got a text asking what was going on in my building, with this picture:
It was news to me.
At 8:55am we got an alert saying &amp;ldquo;Avoid 1300 Univ Ave. Fire and Police on scene for working fire.&amp;rdquo; Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m at 1300 University Avenue!
We could see out the window that there was a campus police officer preventing people from entering the building.</description>

      <description>The New York Times has an article about how Microsoft will have users pay a yearly fee for MS Office, instead of buying it outright.
There&amp;rsquo;s some mention of competition from Google Docs. Why should one still use Microsoft Office? The brilliant Excel graphs!
 As for Google, Mr. DelBene said it has not &amp;ldquo;in any way diminished demand&amp;rdquo; for Office because Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s applications are &amp;ldquo;just so far beyond the capabilities that are in those alternative products.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a nice op-ed in the NY Times about the crazy conviction of seven Italian scientists for failure to warn about an unpredictable earthquake. But I spent quite a while puzzling over the following typo:
The third highlighted line should be in the middle of the fourth one, to give &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;who allow flimsy buildings to be built&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how such an error can occur.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a PDF of the full article.</description>

      <description>I was at a CIDR Access Committee meeting in DC a few weeks ago. We review proposals for genotyping or sequencing by the Center for Inherited Disease Research, a service funded by several of the NIH institutes.
We had to buy our own coffee.
It&amp;rsquo;s silly to complain. There was a coffee shop across the hall from the meeting room, and the coffee there was suitable.
But isn&amp;rsquo;t it silly to pay airfare for a dozen people for a 3 hr meeting and then chintz on the snacks?</description>

      <description>The Madison airport now has a bottle-filling machine, sort of like this:
Bottle filler/drinking fountains are being installed all over the UW-Madison campus, too.
I really love these things. All airports should have them.</description>

      <description>The other day, I was sitting on campus, in the woods overlooking Lake Mendota, reading a journal article, and a campus police officer came up to me.
The conversation went something like this:
 Police: What&amp;rsquo;s going on?
Me: I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying the day.
Police: Are you staff?
Me: I&amp;rsquo;m faculty.
Police: I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying the day, too.
 And then he walked off.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure who was more suspicious, him of me or me of him.</description>

      <description>A newsletter from the Madison B-Cycle folks pointed out that the biking laws in Wisconsin have been revised somewhat, in interesting ways (at least to me).
  You can now stick your arm out to the right to signal a right turn. (I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that this was wrong.)   Studded bike tires (important for riding on snow and ice) are now legal. (I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that they weren&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>We don&amp;rsquo;t get many kids seeking candy at our house. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if there just aren&amp;rsquo;t many kids in the neighborhood, or if it&amp;rsquo;s our location (next to the pond, with a big gap before the next house).
I decided to keep track. As usual, we bought a huge bag of candy, and we still had about half of it left to hand out tonight. But only 19 kids came.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m at the useR! Conference in Coventry, UK, this week. It&amp;rsquo;s been every bit as inspiring, interesting and useful as I&amp;rsquo;d hoped.
Particularly interesting were the Lightning talks: a series of 5 minute presentations with one minute in between, with each presentation having 15 slides of 20 sec each, moved forward automatically. It worked extremely well; more talks should be done this way!
And particularly interesting, among the lightning talks, was one by Tal Galili, who started the R-bloggers blog aggregator.</description>
