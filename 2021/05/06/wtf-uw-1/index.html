      <p>I&rsquo;m just a statistician trying to write software, devise statistical
methods, and muck around with data, to help my scientific
collaborators. I&rsquo;ve had no formal training in the politics of higher
education, or even in teaching for that matter. But ugh the shit
that&rsquo;s been happening around <a href="https://www.wisc.edu">UW-Madison</a> lately. I
need to follow the example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatole_Beck">Anatole
Beck</a> and start speaking
up and speaking out.</p>

Kim</a>
wrote two articles in the <a href="https://madison.com/ct/">Capital Times</a> in
the last year that really pissed me off:</p>
<ul>
<li>2020-10-24: <a href="https://madison.com/ct/news/local/education/uw-math-lecturer-of-30-years-claims-abuse-of-academic-staff-hiring-policies/article_d1cded96-5967-5f3b-946e-5aefc65bf159.html">UW math lecturer or 30+ years claims &lsquo;abuse&rsquo; of
academic staff hiring policies</a></li>
<li>2021-01-15: <a href="https://madison.com/ct/news/local/education/uw-rejects-instructors-grievance-citing-systemic-harassment-in-math-department-hiring/article_cda84284-d7e0-54ed-a843-1fb64db8352d.html">UW rejects instructor&rsquo;s grievance citing &lsquo;systemic harassment&rsquo; in math department hiring</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sharad Chandarana had taught in the UW-Madison <a href="https://math.wisc.edu/">math
department</a> since 1985. But he had not had a
permanent position. Rather, they gave him temporary appointments for
a semester or a year at a time. And the math department was careful to
offer only a few consecutive years of teaching at a time before laying
him off for a couple of semesters, because there&rsquo;s a university policy
that says if you&rsquo;ve been teaching for three or more years they have to
give you a proper position with benefits.</p>
<p>2020 – 1985 = 35 years, ffs</p>
<p>The email he got from the department on 5 March 2020 said, &ldquo;As you know,
the university does not allow short term instructor hires for more
than 3 years in a row, after 3 years the position would need to be
converted into a permanent one. There are no current plans for such a
position. I am really sorry about this situation, but because of this
I cannot offer you a teaching assignment for next year.”</p>
<p>Sharad complained, and the math department forwarded his complaint to the
Academic Staff Appeals Committee, which ultimately voted not to process his
grievance because the department <em>did not violate university policy</em>. He
alleged violation of Academic Staff Policies and Procedures, but they
said that didn&rsquo;t apply to him because he had never held a teaching
appointment for three consecutive years.</p>
<p>The university&rsquo;s treatment of Sharad over his career (from
aged 30 to 65, it seems) was just so terrible. And then to say &ldquo;Well,
it was in accordance with the rules,&rdquo; ugh somehow that&rsquo;s even more
embarrassing.</p>
<p>On 21 March 2021, Sharad announced that he was moving to Florida.</p>
