    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Back in 1999, when I interviewed for my first faculty job (in the
<a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/">biostatistics
department</a> at the
<a href="https://www.jhsph.edu">Johns Hopkins School of Public Health</a>), I got
to meet with the Dean, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Sommer">Al
Sommer</a>.
He talked about how collegial the faculty are at
Hopkins, and also about his <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fs0140-6736%2886%2991157-8">work on vitamin
A</a>, which showed
that an inexpensive vitamin A supplement aimed at reducing childhood
blindness had the surprising result of also reducing mortality.</p>
<p>I remember I asked him two questions: Why were faculty at Hopkins so
collegial (he thought it was because they didn&rsquo;t have to compete with each
other for promotion), and why did he leave his important research efforts to
become a Dean (he didn&rsquo;t fully leave research, and he felt like he
could have an even bigger impact by helping to enable others&rsquo; work).</p>
<p>In my eight years at Hopkins, I really felt
like the focus was on the work itself and the impact it was having,
like the efforts to eradicate smallpox and polio. There was the
whole <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2001/bloomberg-name.html">Bloomberg
business</a>
and the <a href="https://kbroman.org/blog/2012/11/16/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-1/">expensive new school
logo</a>,
but even the discussion of the &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; $100 million donation for a
malaria center (at least the part that wasn&rsquo;t about
Bloomberg) was focused on the possibility of eradicating malaria.</p>
<p>Early in my time at Hopkins, a number of us junior
biostatistics faculty had a mentoring meeting with <a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/faculty/brookmeyer">Ron
Brookmeyer</a>, at which he suggested
that if you were choosing between writing a substantial methods paper
and writing a grant, he would recommend writing the paper. It
would have a bigger impact and would make it easier to get that
next grant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not advice that I can imagine being given here at
<a href="https://www.wisc.edu">UW-Madison</a>. Maybe I was just naive, but I
really felt like people at Hopkins were focused on the work first and
the money to enable the work second. Here there&rsquo;s a lot of talk of the
<a href="https://www.wisc.edu/wisconsin-idea/">Wisconsin Idea</a> and <a href="https://news.wisc.edu/sifting-and-winnowing-turns-125/">sifting
and
winnowing</a>,
but the New Wisconsin Idea seems to be <em>money</em>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://research.wisc.edu/about/leadership/">Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education
(VCRGE)</a> gives an annual
presentation to the <a href="https://secfac.wisc.edu/governance/faculty-senate/">Faculty
Senate</a> about
the state of campus research.
These types of presentations can be expected to focus on money (where do we rank in terms of
research expenditures in relation to other universities and what can
we do to reverse our sliding position), but I&rsquo;ve been surprised that
the focus is <em>solely</em> on money.
In 2020 (back when we could meet in person), he said that
Centers and Institutes bring in the big dollars and so to improve our
research rankings we should have more Centers and Institutes. This
year he emphasized faculty involvement on COVID-related research,
but rather than discuss the work itself (which would be of immediate
interest to all of us), he just emphasized how
they&rsquo;d taken advantage of COVID-related research
opportunities to bring in X million dollars in new funding.</p>
<p>At a discussion among faculty who were forming a new Center, the interim director
started a list of <em>Opportunities</em> on the white board, and the first
thing on the list was <em>money</em>. How can we use the Center to get
more money to support our own research?</p>
<p>There was an opportunity for grants for workshops on reproducible research,
but each campus was allowed to submit just one proposal. Another group
was submitting the proposal, and I was asked about my involvement in the effort.
Because &ldquo;if the proposal fails then it&rsquo;s no skin off our noses by not engaging, but if it goes through then we&rsquo;re probably
out of the game at least in terms of NIH funding. In that case we
could still participate though with no funding for that mandate unless
it&rsquo;s built in now.&rdquo; What mattered was not to have the best
possible training available, or even to help our colleagues to
write a successful proposal, but just to get some of the money.</p>
<p>More generally, I&rsquo;ve felt that with graduate education, there has been
a <em>much</em> bigger focus on getting NIH training grants than on actually
improving the graduate curriculum itself. We don&rsquo;t take time to talk
about how we might improve the existing courses (which is hard);
rather we focus on how to spin the existing curriculum into something
that sounds good in a grant proposal.</p>
<p>Our department meetings now start with announcements of grants that
people have gotten. We don&rsquo;t talk at all about papers people have
published, or talks or workshops people have given, or cool results or
software tools. Just grants.</p>
<p>Again, maybe I have just been naive, and maybe I&rsquo;ve just grown into
this awareness that scientific research is focused on money first and
results second. Johns Hopkins and UW-Madison differ in a lot of
ways, and a lot of things have changed in my 14 years in Madison, and so
sure this probably isn&rsquo;t a UW-Madison-specific problem. But I feel
like academic research here has lost its way. In focusing on
research expenditures as the key measure of research productivity,
they&rsquo;ve forgotten that the money is in order to <em>do stuff</em>, and it&rsquo;s the
<em>doing of the stuff</em> that should matter, not the money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve focused on extreme cases. People here <em>do</em> care about the work
itself. But so many slip into the trap &ldquo;good science is big science,&rdquo;
and the celebration of money can be so blatant.</p>
