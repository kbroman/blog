      <description>Following up on my post about my heart arrhythmia, and my post about my current covid infection too: yesterday I was wearing my Polar H10 chest strap and watching my PVCs on my Android app, and I noticed very frequent PVCs. My heart seemed to be alternately between bigeminy (every other beat a PVC) and trigeminy (every third beat a PVC). I was also feeling particularly crappy from the covid.</description>

      <description>Last December, I caught COVID for the first time, and I ended up having symptoms for 14 days and continuing to test positive on at-home rapid-tests for 18 days. I was testing daily at that point, and didn&amp;rsquo;t exit isolation until day 21, after 3 days of negative tests. I think I caught the infection early, and I started on Paxlovid immediately, and sort of wonder whether the Paxlovid contributed to the infection having lasted so long.</description>

      <description>This is a long story about a personal health issue, but it&amp;rsquo;s also about programming and data analysis.
PVCs Early last year, a phlebotomist at the Red Cross (where I was donating platelets), when taking my pulse, observed that my heart was doing a bit of tango: beat-beat-pause-beat-beat-pause.
I had an appointment for a physical the following week, so I asked about it there, and the nurse confirmed the strange pulse rhythm.</description>

      <description>A new academic year has begun, and this year it seems that we&amp;rsquo;re on our own, when it comes to protecting ourselves against COVID-19. In the latest guidance from the CDC and UW-Madison, we&amp;rsquo;re told that &amp;ldquo;individual responsibility&amp;rdquo; is sufficient to combat infectious disease.
From the UW-Madison FAQ about COVID:
 Is it okay to ask someone I work with if they have been vaccinated? No. A person&amp;rsquo;s vaccination status is private, just like any other medical issue or condition, and employees should not be asked to share this information.</description>

      <description>The UW Health nurses have been seeking recognition of their union. UW Health claims that it cannot legally recognize their union, but Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul issued an opinion that UW Health can voluntarily recognize their union. Yesterday, the nurses voted to hold a 3-day strike, Sept 13-15, 2022. (See the articles in the Wisconsin State Journal and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.)

      <description>This is the fifth and final installment of my &amp;ldquo;Karl is so naive&amp;rdquo; series.
I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently become aware of the big conflict between graduate student mentors&#39; dual roles of advisor and employer. Now I see it everywhere.
Should they take further courses? No just focus on research.
Should they help out at a software workshop or take on a teaching assistant position or spend the summer doing an internship in industry?</description>

      <description>If you want an instant reaction from me, use the word &amp;ldquo;incentivize.&amp;rdquo; For example, &amp;ldquo;How can we incentivize faculty to improve their courses?&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s a strong push to insert capitalism and competition into everything we do.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen faculty job interviews in action, you likely agree that academics could use a bit of infusion of professionalism or at least some training in how not to be an asshole. But the drive to make universities more like businesses just turns them into shitty corporations with values that have been twisted away from what&amp;rsquo;s actually important.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in a position of great privilege: a tenured full professor with solid funding, a history of success in both methodology and collaborative research, and some well-used software packages. So it seems wrong for me to complain about a lack of respect.
When I joined the faculty at UW-Madison in 2007, I felt like the administration had our backs and the state legislators were the only ones to be concerned about.</description>

      <description>Back in 1999, when I interviewed for my first faculty job (in the biostatistics department at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health), I got to meet with the Dean, Al Sommer. He talked about how collegial the faculty are at Hopkins, and also about his work on vitamin A, which showed that an inexpensive vitamin A supplement aimed at reducing childhood blindness had the surprising result of also reducing mortality.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m just a statistician trying to write software, devise statistical methods, and muck around with data, to help my scientific collaborators. I&amp;rsquo;ve had no formal training in the politics of higher education, or even in teaching for that matter. But ugh the shit that&amp;rsquo;s been happening around UW-Madison lately. I need to follow the example of Anatole Beck and start speaking up and speaking out.
Yvonne Kim wrote two articles in the Capital Times in the last year that really pissed me off:</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve not heard, there&amp;rsquo;s a big move away from Travis to GitHub Actions for continuous testing of R packages. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad for the infrastructure to help, but it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of work to figure it out.
But that&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about today. Today I want to talk about using docker to debug an R package that is throwing an error in the development version of R. This came up because with the new GitHub Actions infrastructure, I can now test my R packages on multiple OSs and with multiple versions of R, and today R/qtl was shown to throw an error in R-devel.</description>

      <description>A student asked me about how to include summary results in the abstract or executive summary at the top of an R Markdown report when they don&amp;rsquo;t get calculated until somewhere below.
I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a generally accepted solution to this, but I can&amp;rsquo;t find it. I thought maybe Keith Baggerly mentioned this in his slides about good reproducible reports, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to. I did find this RStudio Community discussion that is relevant, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have quite the solution I would want.</description>

      <description>In October I agreed to participate in the ReScience Ten Years Reproducibility Challenge. The idea is to take a paper that you published at least ten years ago and try to re-run the code. Brilliant!
I looked back through my pre-2010 papers and chose Lamichhane et al. (2003) on the analysis of a transposon mutagenesis experiment in M. tuberculosis. I picked that one in part because I figured the analyses were reasonably compact and not super time consuming.</description>

      <description>I was looking through some of my old notes and came across this list of &amp;ldquo;data analysis principles&amp;rdquo;.
 answer the question understand where the data came from make a graph does the result make sense? if it seems too good to be true, it probably is form a diagnostic checklist: think of ways things could go wrong and how they might be revealed follow up on all aberrations every estimate needs an SE consider taking logs consider taking differences use common axis scales avoid normality assumptions remember Simpson&amp;rsquo;s paradox  I also found this list of &amp;ldquo;key statistics concepts&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I’m in Delft, The Netherlands, for a few days this week, at a workshop to develop guidelines for reproducibility for AGILE conference papers. I’m here as one of the outside “experts”. (It’s always a bit disconcerting to be considered an expert.) The leaders of this effort wrote an interesting PeerJ paper last year, evaluating the reproducibility of previous AGILE papers.
There will be a community webinar tomorrow (2019-04-02) at 16:00 CEST (which is 9:00am US central daylight time), to report our initial thoughts and get community feedback.</description>

      <description>At his talk at RStudio::conf, Karthik Ram discussed binder as a useful solution for reproducible research (see the video), and I thought, &amp;ldquo;What is this dark magic?&amp;rdquo; You put a small configuration file in your GitHub repository and suddenly you can open it live in RStudio on some cloud server somewhere. Seems too good to be true. But I trusted him, mentioned it in my talk at AAAS yesterday, and talked it up to Jeff Leek.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been nearly two years since I attended the RopenSci UnConf 2017 in LA and worked with Gergely Daróczi, Brooke Anderson, David Smith, Mario Inchiosa, and Adi Zaidi to create the miner package for interacting with Minecraft from R. We spent a half-day writing the package and then a day and a half playing, with a bunch of our ideas implemented in the craft package and illustrated in the bookdown book, R programming with Minecraft.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d long been a MacBook Pro user. I went through like 6 or 8 of them. My favorites were the 17&amp;quot; ones. Heavy, but that big screen was great for data analysis, programming, and writing papers.
Mac OSX seemed designed just for me: unix minus the trouble, plus Word. But it seems like Apple is now designing with someone totally different in mind. I mean, my MacPro desktop is on its last legs but hell if I&amp;rsquo;m going to buy one of their new ones which are basically like a laptop that you sit on your desk.</description>

      <description>What I’ve liked most about Twitter is that it’s helped me to feel less isolated, as I’ve been able to connect with distant folks who share my interests and values, particularly regarding open science and reproducible research.
But somehow, lately, Twitter had me feeling less rather than more connected. I think maybe it’s been that conference effect: scientific conferences are great for catching up with old friends and seeing all of the cool things that everyone’s doing, but ultimately they often leave me feeling like crap because everyone else seems to be doing cool and exciting stuff while I gave a talk on the same old stuff I’ve been working on for five years with little apparent progress.</description>

      <description>I’ve long been an advocate for statisticians (and other data scientists) to become proficient in multiple programming languages. Fifteen years ago, I said, “Think CPR: C for speed, R for interactive data analysis and graphics, and Perl for manipulating data files.” I’d now substitute C++ for C, and Python or Ruby for Perl, but the general sentiment stands: use the language that best fits the problem at hand.
More blather about languages Long ago, I wrote a tutorial on Perl.</description>

      <description>At the 2016 JSM in Chicago, in a session honoring William Cleveland, a speaker’s repeated use of the phrase “these guys”, when referring to programmers, made me livid.
I’ve just become ACUTELY aware that we should not say “these guys” when referring to programmers or analysts in a talk. #JSM2016

      <description>So I was trying to parse this gff file from MGI, with mouse gene annotations. And, well, I’m an idiot. But in a way that is potentially instructive.
The documentation for the file is a docx file (not really a recommended format for such metadata), but it seems rather simple, really: tab delimited, with 9 columns, the ninth column being a bunch of pasted attributes that needs to be further parsed, but we’ll skip over that detail.</description>

      <description>In addition to our miner package and our in-development bookdown book, the R/minecraft team from the ROpenSci Unconference had created a bunch of other useful code for interacting with Minecraft from R, which we&amp;rsquo;re putting into a second package.
I initially called this extra package &amp;ldquo;miner.extra&amp;rdquo;. (And I learned some new things about the rules for what characters can be used in R package names.) But then this evening I realized, &amp;ldquo;Hey, we could call it craft.</description>

      <description>So I heard Yihui Xie talk about bookdown, and I read, with considerable excitement, his bookdown book. (There&amp;rsquo;s a blurb from me at Amazon saying nice things about it, after all). But I must admit that I read the book on my iPad, with my feet up. And so my understanding, while reasonably complete, was somewhat theoretical.
I mean, from my own book writing experience, I felt like, &amp;ldquo;Hell if I&amp;rsquo;m going to be writing another book.</description>

      <description>If, in teaching folks about the magrittr pipe operator, %&amp;gt;%, you&amp;rsquo;re looking for an in-the-wild example of deeply nested functions, our miner package (for connecting R to Minecraft, developed at the ROpenSci 2017 Unconference) has a good one:

This was ROpenSci&amp;rsquo;s 4th unconference; the first I could attend. There were like 70 participants, nearly double what they had last year. The scheme is that people break up into groups and work on different projects that might be useful to the ROpenSci community. There was discussion about potential projects in advance on GitHub, and then the first morning we voted on what we were interested in doing via stickers:</description>

I was chatting with Śaunak Sen about preparations: the main problem is installation of R/qtl2, which is split into multiple R packages, and I’ve not yet placed them on CRAN. And they’re a bit of a pain to install from GitHub (people need the proper development tools, and compilation of the C++ code is painfully slow).</description>

      <description>Matt Dowle encouraged me to follow up on my post about sqlite, feather, and fst. One thing to emphasize is that saveRDS, by default, uses compression. If you use compress=FALSE you can skip that and it goes much faster. See, for example, his post on “Fast csv writing for R”. Also see his slides from a recent presentation on parallel fread.
I’ll first generate the same data that I was using before.</description>
