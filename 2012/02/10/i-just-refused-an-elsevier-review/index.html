    <div class="article-content">
      <p>This afternoon I refused a request from the American Journal of Human Genetics to review a paper, though the abstract was extremely interesting.  AJHG is published by Elsevier, and I&rsquo;d signed the declaration at <a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com">http://thecostofknowledge.com</a> to not publish or review for Elsevier journals.  If only AJHG were still with the University of Chicago Press&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=890">Michael Eisen recently wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
The boycott isn't perfect. I wish they hadn't focused exclusively on Elsevier – they are hardly the only bad actors in the field. And it's crucial that the focus be on papers. Nobody views turning down invitations to review to be a big sacrifice – and publishers will just find someone else. Same thing with editors. But papers are their lifeblood.
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with him.  It&rsquo;s easy to turn down a review. (I do so several times a week.)</p>

<p>And so I was feeling quite unsure about turning down the review, but also unsure about breaking the pledge regarding Elsevier.  Nevertheless, I came down on the side of the pledge, and responded to AJHG with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
It sounds like an interesting paper, but...

I recently signed a public declaration to not publish or review for
Elsevier journals (<a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com">http://thecostofknowledge.com</a>).  I noticed at the time that Am J Hum Genet was published by Elsevier (if only it were still at U Chicago Press), which could be a problem.

I'm having second thoughts (especially in that refusing a review for this reason seems too easy...I say no to review requests almost every day), but for now I'm sticking to my promise.
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure whether it was the right decision.</p>

<p>I think the most important thing for me to do is to work to get <a href="http://www.genetics.org">Genetics</a> to become open-access, or at least encourage  discussion along those lines at the <a href="http://www.genetics-gsa.org">Genetics Society of America</a>.</p>
