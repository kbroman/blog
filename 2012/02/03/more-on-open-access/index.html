    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I am quite persuaded by <a href="http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=890">Michael Eisen&rsquo;s recent comments on open access</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;it is simply unacceptable for any scientist who decries Elsevier&rsquo;s actions and believes that the subscription based model is no longer serving science to send a single additional paper to journals that do not provide full OA [open access] to every paper they publish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how can I do that if <a href="https://academic.oup.com/genetics">Genetics</a> isn&rsquo;t fully open?  Genetics charges an extra $1200 to make an article open access.  Would it really cost $1200 per article to make the journal fully open?</p>
<p>Another follow-up to <a href="https://kbroman.org/blog/2012/02/02/paying-for-scholarly-publications/">my comments yesterday</a>: I had suggested that copyright law might be changed to make papers coming from federal research grants fully open.  I later found an interesting paper in the <a href="https://jla.oxfordjournals.org">Journal of Legal Analysis</a>, <a href="https://jla.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/1/301.abstract">Should copyright of academic works be abolished?</a>  The author concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;if publication fees would be largely defrayed by universities and grantors, as I suggest would be to their advantage, then the elimination of copyright of academic works would likely be socially desirable: it would not compromise academic publication activity and would yield the social benefits of a copyright-free regime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read the whole paper, and there&rsquo;s a bit of quantitative analysis that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll like, but it does provide a thorough argument for what I see as the real need: to change copyright law.  Still, I&rsquo;m not sure that monographs should be treated the same as journal articles.</p>
<p>Another interesting point: The <a href="https://jla.oxfordjournals.org">Journal of Legal Analysis</a> is open access (articles are published under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial licence</a>), and it seems to be funded in part through the endowment model I&rsquo;d mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The journal is underwritten by a generous grant from the Considine Family Foundation, and continues to enjoy the strong support of the Harvard Law School and the John M. Olin Center for Law, Economics, and Business.</p>
