    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Clay Johnson, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449304680">The Information Diet</a>, recently wrote about <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5920033/how-to-prep-for-a-presentation">how to prepare to give a presentation</a>.</p>

<p>I was shocked.</p>

<p>First, he says</p>

<blockquote>When I started writing my book, I knew that authors generally make more money from speaking than they do from royalties, so I wanted my talks on the Information Diet to be great.</blockquote>

<p>I probably should have stopped there, since we clearly have completely different goals.  He wrote a book and is giving talks in order to make money?</p>

<p>He goes on to suggest a course of preparation that involves an <em>enormous</em> amount of practice.</p>

<p>I guess stand-up comics do that, but me: I&rsquo;ll flip through my slides and think through the tricky bits, but mostly I rely on experience and innate ability.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/giving_talks.pdf">a talk I gave about giving talks</a>, I mentioned that others have said to do 10 practice runs for every presentation.  But for me, my practice run is the time I gave the talk to a different group.  I can&rsquo;t stand the sound of my voice, and I&rsquo;m certainly not going to watch myself on video, not even <a href="http://tinyurl.com/7ulrh6z">this short one</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson suggests having a test audience, in part to try out one&rsquo;s jokes.  The intended humor in my talks is almost entirely spontaneous; if I have idea for a joke in advance, I will generally abandon it, as if I think about it too much it will just seem stupid.</p>

<p>The main reason I don&rsquo;t practice talks is that I don&rsquo;t want to waste time; it would take a lot of practice to get just a bit of improvement, and I could spend that time writing or programming or looking at data.</p>

<p>Also, I think if I give a talk too much, by practicing or otherwise, I&rsquo;ll be less excited and interested in the material.  Without practice, I&rsquo;m not so polished, but I&rsquo;m more enthusiastic.</p>
