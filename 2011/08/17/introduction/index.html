    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I&rsquo;m at the <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/statsdept/user-2011/">useR! Conference</a> in Coventry, UK, this week. It&rsquo;s been every bit as inspiring, interesting and useful as I&rsquo;d hoped.</p>

<p>Particularly interesting were the <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/statsdept/user-2011/lightning.html">Lightning talks</a>: a series of 5 minute presentations with one minute in between, with each presentation having 15 slides of 20 sec each, moved forward automatically.  It worked extremely well; more talks should be done this way!</p>

<p>And particularly interesting, among the lightning talks, was one by <a href="http://www.r-statistics.com">Tal Galili</a>, who started the <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-bloggers</a> blog aggregator. He encouraged the R community to blog. A particularly important point, for me, was his emphasis on not feeling a need to blog at great frequency: even once per year would be worthwhile.</p>

<p>I had a blog in the past, but I felt a constant urge to be posting, and so felt guilty for not posting.  I have enough feelings of guilt in my life, and so I decided to just drop the blog.</p>

<p>Also, my previous effort focused largely on personal matters (particularly my experiences as a new parent).  It perhaps got a bit too personal.  Here, I&rsquo;m going to focus on less personal things, or at least on things that might embarrass me but aren&rsquo;t likely to embarrass my family.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;ve been thinking about blogging recently.  There are a number of blogs that I read regularly and quite enjoy, particularly those of <a href="http://andrewgelman.com">Andrew Gelman</a>, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/">PZ Myers</a>, <a href="http://genome.fieldofscience.com">Steven Salzberg</a>, <a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com">Jerry Coyne</a>, and <a href="http://www.blaghag.com">Jen McCreight</a>.  (Apologies to Prof. Coyne; his is a web site, <a href="http://http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/04/18/encomium/">not a blog</a>.)  I have strong opinions, I like to share them, and I&rsquo;m not often asked to share them, and here I can share freely without prompting.</p>

<p>So: statistics (especially graphics and computing), genetics (especially recombination and QTL mapping), programming (particularly R), and academics (the mistakes I&rsquo;ve made and what I&rsquo;ve learned).</p>

<p>Since I generally still feel like an amateur in all of these matters (and I like to say: &ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re an expert when everyone else&rsquo;s work looks just as crappy as your own.&rdquo;), I won&rsquo;t worry too much about getting everything right.  I certainly will want to avoid comparing myself to the people mentioned above.</p>
