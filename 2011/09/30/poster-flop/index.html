    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I gave <a href="https://kbroman.org/blog/2011/09/16/my-first-fancy-poster/">my first fancy poster</a> yesterday, at MathBio3.</p>
<p>I was hoping to use the experience as an opportunity to talk about how great poster sessions can be, and to refer to Terry Speed&rsquo;s old <a href="http://bulletin.imstat.org/category/terences-stuff/">IMS bulletin column</a> in praise of poster sessions [<a href="https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/terry/Bulletin34_06.pdf">pdf</a>], and then to go on to discuss how, for me, the interpersonal interactions at poster sessions are rather awkward. (For example, if you look at someone&rsquo;s poster for a while, with the presenter standing there watching you, are you obliged to ask a question, or can you slink off?)</p>
<p>However, other than two people I knew and lassoed over, I had just one person look at my poster. (He <em>was</em> nice enough to ask me to explain it.)</p>
<p>What went wrong?  Here are some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is some design flaw in my poster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m scary to look at</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My poster was in a bad location (at the end rather than the middle)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was 5:30pm and people just wanted to drink</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m a loser</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to conclude <em>location</em>.</p>
<p>As at many conferences, the posters were not treated well.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The poster abstracts were not distributed (not even titles were given)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The poster session was at the end of the day (not last, but next-to-last)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The poster session was only 1 hour long, and it started 20 min late (the talks went over time)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They did have 10/30 poster presenters give a 1 minute introduction to their poster, right before the session.  That worked very well (for those 10 people).</p>
