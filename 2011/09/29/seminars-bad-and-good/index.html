<p><a href="http://rafalab.jhsph.edu">Rafael Irizarry</a> <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/10686092687/25-minute-seminars">recently proposed</a> that the standard 50 min seminar be reduced to 25 min, with the extra time devoted to discussion. I <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/10686092687/25-minute-seminars#comment-320436760">commented there</a> but should have just written at greater length here. I&rsquo;ll do so now.</p>

<h3 id="bad-seminars">Bad seminars</h3>

<p>The overriding characteristic of a bad seminar is a lack of empathy for the audience.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Skipping the motivation and jumping into a pile of theory.</p></li>

<li><p>Covering way too much material too quickly.</p></li>

<li><p>Talking about something that is boring and/or trivial.</p></li>

<li><p>Mucking about in details, particularly regarding simulations results.</p></li>

<li><p>Going over time, even by a minute.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Self-censorship is important. If you don&rsquo;t have something new and interesting to say, talk about something old and interesting or don&rsquo;t talk.</p>

<h3 id="good-seminars">Good seminars</h3>

<p>An interesting topic (particularly, interesting data with an interesting question) trumps almost all else. I can be entertained with drivel, but afterwards I&rsquo;ll realize it was drivel.</p>

<p>Show the data first. Skip the outline slide and jump into the data. With the problem understood, you can then explain how you&rsquo;ll spend the rest of our time.</p>

<p>Focus on one thing and explain it well. I don&rsquo;t want to see everything you&rsquo;ve done in the last year or two, especially if it means it&rsquo;ll be too fast to be understood; I just want to understand one thing that you&rsquo;ve been thinking about.</p>

<p>Know your audience. Know what you should explain and what you can leave unexplained. (If in doubt, explain it. Most people are happy to hear a nice summary of something they know well, and if you lose them, you&rsquo;re not likely to ever get them back.) Know what people will find interesting and what they will want skipped over.  This will be different for different audiences.</p>

<p>Skip the details of simulations results. Since you can modify the settings to get almost anything, I don&rsquo;t really want to see detailed power curves (and definitely <em>don&rsquo;t show me tables</em>); skip to the bottom line.</p>

<p>Show lots of pictures, a few words, and almost no formulas. (<a href="http://rafalab.jhsph.edu">Rafa</a> has said to use no Greek letters, and has also said to use only pictures. I say: at least find a way to dispense with the subscripts.)</p>

<p>Label your figures, and not with <code>x[,1]</code> and <code>x[,2]</code>.  Don&rsquo;t copy-and-paste from a paper (unless perhaps it&rsquo;s to demonstrate how crappy the paper is; <em>that&rsquo;s entertainment!</em>).</p>

<p>Give a succinct summary at the end, in case the audience has lost track.</p>

<h3 id="25-minutes">25 minutes?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m warming to the 25 min concept, but I&rsquo;m still cool.  I can generally see how to edit others&rsquo; talks down to 25 min, but my own?  I feel like I need that time.  But perhaps that&rsquo;s because</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I work on such obscure problems that I have to spend 20 min on background.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m lazy.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been trained to talk for 50 min.</p></li>

<li><p>I just like to talk.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Still, it&rsquo;s difficult or impossible to retain audience members&rsquo; attention for much more than 25 min, and I can edit even my own talks to 25 min if I make a few approximations.</p>

<h3 id="however">However</h3>

<p>If we&rsquo;re going to cut seminars to 25 min, let&rsquo;s not fill out the hour with questions and discussion.  Let&rsquo;s just go home early (or chat over coffee).</p>

<p>The discussion period of seminars is seldom so interesting that it deserves so much time.  Of course there are exceptions, but usually it&rsquo;s a few people asking lame purposeless questions.</p>

<p>Perhaps, though, the questions are lame only because we&rsquo;re all tired and want to go home.  After a refreshing 25 min talk, maybe we&rsquo;ll be keen to delve deeper in an unstructured way.</p>
