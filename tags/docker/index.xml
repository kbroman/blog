      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve not heard, there&amp;rsquo;s a big move away from Travis to GitHub Actions for continuous testing of R packages. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad for the infrastructure to help, but it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of work to figure it out.
But that&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about today. Today I want to talk about using docker to debug an R package that is throwing an error in the development version of R. This came up because with the new GitHub Actions infrastructure, I can now test my R packages on multiple OSs and with multiple versions of R, and today R/qtl was shown to throw an error in R-devel.</description>
