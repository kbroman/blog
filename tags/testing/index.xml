      <description>Since 2000, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on R/qtl, an R package for mapping the genetic loci (called quantitative trait loci, QTL) that contribute to variation in quantitative traits in experimental crosses. The Bioinformatics paper about it is my most cited; also see my 2014 JORS paper, &amp;ldquo;Fourteen years of R/qtl: Just barely sustainable.&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a miracle that R/qtl works and gives the right answers, as it includes essentially no formal tests.</description>

      <title>Session info from R/Travis</title>

      <description>For the problem I reported yesterday, in which my R package was working fine locally but failing on Travis, the key solution is to run update.packages(ask=FALSE) locally, and maybe even update.packages(ask=FALSE, type=&amp;quot;source&amp;quot;) to be sure to grab the source of packages for which binaries are not yet available. I now know to do that.
In addition, it&amp;rsquo;d be useful to have session information (R and package versions) in the results from Travis.</description>

      <title>Testing an R package&#39;s interactive graphs</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on an R package, R/qtlcharts, with D3-based interactive graphs for quantitative trait locus mapping experiments.
Testing the interactive charts it produces is a bit of a pain. It seems like I pretty much have to just open a series of examples in a web browser and tab through them manually, checking that they look okay, that the interactions seem to work, and that they&amp;rsquo;re not giving any sort of errors.</description>
