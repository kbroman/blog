      <description>An odd thing happened to me on twitter today.
UW System had tweeted a statement from system president Ray Cross concerning Trump&amp;rsquo;s executive order banning refugees and immigrants from 7 countries. Cross&amp;rsquo;s statement is close to the most empty, useless possible such statement.
So I tweeted back, asking him to revise his statement and actually take a stand against Trump&amp;rsquo;s executive order.

Note that I mentioned not just @RayWCross and @UWSystem, but also @POTUS.</description>
