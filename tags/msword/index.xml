      <description>Collaboration on grant proposals has forced me to spend a lot of time writing in MS Word lately.

(It&amp;rsquo;s maybe not as bad as typing Markdown marks within a LaTeX document, which I&amp;rsquo;ve also been doing.)
A google search on the title of this post got me to this post.</description>
