      <description>I got the following email.
 Subject: i have a question? Date: May 18, 2012 7:57:56 AM CDT how can i enter the data of QTL analysis.  That was the whole thing.
I presume that the writer wishes to use my R/qtl software.
I could probably respond helpfully (for example, “See the sample data files and code at the R/qtl web site.”), but can&amp;rsquo;t I expect more from people seeking my help?</description>
