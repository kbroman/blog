      <description>A certain photo of me has been following me around for some time.
Karl with a mustache, 15 Nov 2002
The thing is sitting on my website, so I suppose I have only myself to blame. I actually quite like the photo. I look happy. I was happy. I&amp;rsquo;m not always happy.
It&amp;rsquo;s shown up in a lot of talks, particularly by a certain friend of mine.
It appeared on the seminar board at Hopkins Biostat earlier this month.</description>
