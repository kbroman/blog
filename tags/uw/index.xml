      <description>A new academic year has begun, and this year it seems that we&amp;rsquo;re on our own, when it comes to protecting ourselves against COVID-19. In the latest guidance from the CDC and UW-Madison, we&amp;rsquo;re told that &amp;ldquo;individual responsibility&amp;rdquo; is sufficient to combat infectious disease.
From the UW-Madison FAQ about COVID:
Is it okay to ask someone I work with if they have been vaccinated? No. A person&amp;rsquo;s vaccination status is private, just like any other medical issue or condition, and employees should not be asked to share this information.</description>

      <description>The UW Health nurses have been seeking recognition of their union. UW Health claims that it cannot legally recognize their union, but Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul issued an opinion that UW Health can voluntarily recognize their union. Yesterday, the nurses voted to hold a 3-day strike, Sept 13-15, 2022. (See the articles in the Wisconsin State Journal and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.)
Please join me in supporting the UW Health nurses:</description>

      <description>This is the fifth and final installment of my &amp;ldquo;Karl is so naive&amp;rdquo; series.
I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently become aware of the big conflict between graduate student mentors&amp;rsquo; dual roles of advisor and employer. Now I see it everywhere.
Should they take further courses? No just focus on research.
Should they help out at a software workshop or take on a teaching assistant position or spend the summer doing an internship in industry?</description>

      <description>If you want an instant reaction from me, use the word &amp;ldquo;incentivize.&amp;rdquo; For example, &amp;ldquo;How can we incentivize faculty to improve their courses?&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s a strong push to insert capitalism and competition into everything we do.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen faculty job interviews in action, you likely agree that academics could use a bit of infusion of professionalism or at least some training in how not to be an asshole. But the drive to make universities more like businesses just turns them into shitty corporations with values that have been twisted away from what&amp;rsquo;s actually important.</description>

      <title>wtf uw 3: faculty are an impediment</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in a position of great privilege: a tenured full professor with solid funding, a history of success in both methodology and collaborative research, and some well-used software packages. So it seems wrong for me to complain about a lack of respect.
When I joined the faculty at UW-Madison in 2007, I felt like the administration had our backs and the state legislators were the only ones to be concerned about.</description>

      <description>Back in 1999, when I interviewed for my first faculty job (in the biostatistics department at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health), I got to meet with the Dean, Al Sommer. He talked about how collegial the faculty are at Hopkins, and also about his work on vitamin A, which showed that an inexpensive vitamin A supplement aimed at reducing childhood blindness had the surprising result of also reducing mortality.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m just a statistician trying to write software, devise statistical methods, and muck around with data, to help my scientific collaborators. I&amp;rsquo;ve had no formal training in the politics of higher education, or even in teaching for that matter. But ugh the shit that&amp;rsquo;s been happening around UW-Madison lately. I need to follow the example of Anatole Beck and start speaking up and speaking out.
Yvonne Kim wrote two articles in the Capital Times in the last year that really pissed me off:</description>

      <description>UW-Madison faculty got an email update from Vice Provost and Chief Diversity Officer Patrick Sims regarding the things we can do in response to the hate and bias incidents on campus.
Here are the things he had mentioned yesterday at the Faculty Senate meeting:
Address hate/bias incidents in your curriculum to ameliorate unacceptable occurrences in our campus community.
Look at &amp;ldquo;bullying&amp;rdquo; language as a way to address possible hate/bias incidents in the classroom.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a privileged white male university professor. As privileged as they come, really. My father was a professor of chemistry; my mother also has an advanced degree in chemistry. The jobs I&amp;rsquo;ve held have been more about personal fulfillment than money: dancer, dance teacher, secretary for intellectual property lawyers, research and teaching assistant, professor. People assume I know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about, even if I&amp;rsquo;m in shorts and a t-shirt.</description>
