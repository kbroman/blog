      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m enthusiastic about having R notify me when my script is done.
But among my early uses of this, my script threw an error, and I never got a text or pushbullet about that. And really, I&amp;rsquo;m even more interested in being notified about such errors than anything else.
It&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to get notified of errors. At the top of your script, include code like options(error = function() { } )</description>

      <description>You just sent a long R job running. How to know when it&amp;rsquo;s done? Have it notify you by beeping, sending you a text, or sending you a notification via pushbullet.
beepr You can use Rasmus Baath&amp;rsquo;s beepr package to have your computer play a sound.
Install it from CRAN with
install.packages(&amp;quot;beepr&amp;quot;)  Then, at the bottom of your script, load the package and have it beep.

      <description>Collaboration on grant proposals has forced me to spend a lot of time writing in MS Word lately. I find my self typing emacs key strokes and then getting annoyed when I have to move my hand over to the arrow keys. (It&amp;rsquo;s maybe not as bad as typing Markdown marks within a LaTeX document, which I&amp;rsquo;ve also been doing.)
A google search on the title of this post got me to this post.</description>

      <description>One of the more painful things to learn as a faculty member is to accept that you will do some things badly. There are too many things to do, so you can&amp;rsquo;t do them all well. What should you do badly?
As an undergraduate, the scope of work is reasonably precisely defined, and problem sets have relatively simple solutions. I finished things on time or even early, and I seldom felt guilty for not studying.</description>

      <description>Rafael Irizarry wrote about how meetings at work get in the way of actual work.
I agree with his central point, that it can take some time to get back working on a project (whether data analysis, programming, or writing), and so blocks of less than a couple of hours can be inefficient. Meetings that break up a work day can really erode one&amp;rsquo;s productivity: academics often spend too much time meeting and not enough actually working, and three hour-long meetings spaced evenly throughout the day can mean that you don&amp;rsquo;t get anything real done in the other five hours.</description>
