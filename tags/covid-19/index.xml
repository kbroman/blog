      <description>Last December, I caught COVID for the first time, and I ended up having symptoms for 14 days and continuing to test positive on at-home rapid-tests for 18 days. I was testing daily at that point, and didn&amp;rsquo;t exit isolation until day 21, after 3 days of negative tests. I think I caught the infection early, and I started on Paxlovid immediately, and sort of wonder whether the Paxlovid contributed to the invection having lasted so long.</description>
