      <description>I gave my first fancy poster yesterday, at MathBio3.
I was hoping to use the experience as an opportunity to talk about how great poster sessions can be, and to refer to Terry Speed&amp;rsquo;s old IMS bulletin column in praise of poster sessions [pdf], and then to go on to discuss how, for me, the interpersonal interactions at poster sessions are rather awkward. (For example, if you look at someone&amp;rsquo;s poster for a while, with the presenter standing there watching you, are you obliged to ask a question, or can you slink off?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m preparing my first large-format poster (for the MathBio3 conference, here in Madison in two weeks). Previously, my posters had just been on a series of pieces of regular paper. (Consider, for example, this poster from September, 1998.) But no one does that anymore, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to stand out as being archaic. That is, I want to pretend to be modern.
Here&amp;rsquo;s my draft: I got a LaTeX template from Åšaunak Sen, which originally came from Nathaniel Johnston and uses the Beamer poster style.</description>
