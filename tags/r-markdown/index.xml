      <description>A student asked me about how to include summary results in the abstract or executive summary at the top of an R Markdown report when they don&amp;rsquo;t get calculated until somewhere below.
I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a generally accepted solution to this, but I can&amp;rsquo;t find it. I thought maybe Keith Baggerly mentioned this in his slides about good reproducible reports, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to. I did find this RStudio Community discussion that is relevant, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have quite the solution I would want.</description>
