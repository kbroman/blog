      <description>A new academic year has begun, and this year it seems that we&amp;rsquo;re on our own, when it comes to protecting ourselves against COVID-19. In the latest guidance from the CDC and UW-Madison, we&amp;rsquo;re told that &amp;ldquo;individual responsibility&amp;rdquo; is sufficient to combat infectious disease.
From the UW-Madison FAQ about COVID:
Is it okay to ask someone I work with if they have been vaccinated? No. A person&amp;rsquo;s vaccination status is private, just like any other medical issue or condition, and employees should not be asked to share this information.</description>
