      <description>If the topic sounds boring, well, it is really boring. I write it down here in case it&amp;rsquo;s useful to someone.
I was working on a talk about git &amp;amp; GitHub, and chose a different font (Helvetica Neue, sort of the default Apple font). I think the default font for LaTeX/Beamer is a bit too tall and thin for slides. Here&amp;rsquo;s the default:
And here&amp;rsquo;s what I wanted:
But it didn&amp;rsquo;t work on unix It worked fine with XeLaTeX on my Mac, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working in Unix, and I&amp;rsquo;d like the source to be portable to others.</description>

      <description>I gave a presentation in the Statistical Consulting course at UW-Madison today. I&amp;rsquo;ve done so a number of times in the past 6 years. Until today, I&amp;rsquo;d just spoken informally from a few pages of notes. (Earlier this year, I wrote up those notes as a blog post.)
This year, just 45 min before the class, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d quickly create some slides to present. I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be an interesting &amp;ldquo;experiment&amp;rdquo; (not in the formal sense):</description>

      <title>Better-looking LaTeX/Beamer slides</title>

      <description>I like to use LaTeX to make slides for talks, largely because I prefer to write code (rather than use a mouse and menus) for control of things like colors and figure placement.
Most people that use LaTeX to make slides seem to use Beamer, but the resulting slides are usually a bit busy, like this:

I admire Till Tantau for creating Beamer; it was a great idea and it&amp;rsquo;s been widely adopted.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m co-organizing a scientific meeting at the end of May. The abstracts are all in.
We get them in an Excel file, and I was working on a Perl script to parse the file to create a LaTeX file with the abstracts, so we could have nicely formatted versions for review. (I&amp;rsquo;m using Spreadsheet:XLSX for the first time; it&amp;rsquo;s really easy. Why have I always converted Excel files to CSV before parsing them?</description>

      <title>My first fancy poster</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m preparing my first large-format poster (for the MathBio3 conference, here in Madison in two weeks). Previously, my posters had just been on a series of pieces of regular paper. (Consider, for example, this poster from September, 1998.) But no one does that anymore, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to stand out as being archaic. That is, I want to pretend to be modern.
Here&amp;rsquo;s my draft: 
I got a LaTeX template from &amp;#346;aunak Sen, which originally came from Nathaniel Johnston and uses the Beamer poster style.</description>
