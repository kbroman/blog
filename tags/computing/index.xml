      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d long been a MacBook Pro user. I went through like 6 or 8 of them. My favorites were the 17&amp;quot; ones. Heavy, but that big screen was great for data analysis, programming, and writing papers.
Mac OSX seemed designed just for me: unix minus the trouble, plus Word. But it seems like Apple is now designing with someone totally different in mind. I mean, my MacPro desktop is on its last legs but hell if I&amp;rsquo;m going to buy one of their new ones which are basically like a laptop that you sit on your desk.</description>

      <description>It is shocking to me that a statistics department would offer a graduate-level statistical computing course only every fourth year.
I had been arguing for a statistical programming course: that we supplement the usual course on the theory of statistical computing (numerical linear algebra, EM algorithm, MCMC, etc.) with a course on the practice of statistical computing.
But I was assuming that the more theoretical statistical computing course was actually being taught.</description>

      <description>@roguelynn tweeted the other day:
If attendees of this weekend’s intro to python workshop leave with one thing, it’ll be to Google your error messages first and foremost.

      <title>A course in statistical programming</title>

      <description>Graduate students in statistics often take (or at least have the opportunity to take) a statistical computing course, but often such courses are focused on methods (like numerical linear algebra, the EM algorithm, and MCMC) and not on actual coding.
For example, here&amp;rsquo;s a course in &amp;ldquo;advanced statistical computing&amp;rdquo; that I taught at Johns Hopkins back in 2001.
Many (perhaps most) good programmers learned to code outside of formal courses. But many statisticians are terrible programmers and would benefit by a formal course.</description>
