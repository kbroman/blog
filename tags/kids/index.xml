      <description>@wrathematics pointed me to his ngram R package for constructing and simulating from n-grams from text.
I&amp;rsquo;d recently grabbed the text of the hobbit, and so I applied it to that text, with amusing results.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the code I used to grab the text.
library(XML) stem &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;http://www.5novels.com/classics/u5688&amp;quot; hobbit &amp;lt;- NULL for(i in 1:74) { ```r cat(i,&amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;) if(i==1) { url &amp;lt;- paste0(stem, &amp;quot;.html&amp;quot;) } else { url &amp;lt;- paste0(stem, &amp;quot;_&amp;quot;, i, &amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>Matt Maenner asked about the sawtooth pattern in the figure in my last post on Chutes &amp;amp; Ladders.
Damn you, Matt! I thought I was done with this. Don&amp;rsquo;t feed my obsession.
My response was that if the game ends early, it&amp;rsquo;s even more likely that it&amp;rsquo;ll be the kid who went first who won. But, my intuition was wrong: exactly the opposite is true. It is the advantage to the first player that causes the sawtooth pattern, but that advantage increases with the number of rounds rather than decreases.</description>

      <title>Chutes &amp; ladders: How long is this going to take?</title>

      <description>I was playing Chutes &amp;amp; Ladders with my four-year-old daughter yesterday, and I thought, &amp;ldquo;How long is this going to take?&amp;rdquo;
I saw an interesting mathematical analysis of the game a few years ago, but it seems to be offline, though you can read it via the wayback machine.
But that didn&amp;rsquo;t answer my specific question, namely, &amp;ldquo;How long is this going to take?&amp;rdquo;
So I wrote a bit of R code to simulate the game.</description>
