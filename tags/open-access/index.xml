      <title>Copyright of video lectures</title>

      <description>Quite a while back, I was wondering about copyright of video lectures produced by university faculty. In particular, did I need to get the university to sign some sort of waiver in order for the Jackson Laboratory to post a video of a lecture I&amp;rsquo;d given for a course there? (The Jackson Lab lawyers wanted that.)
I spoke to my family librarian, who pointed me to Carrie Kruse, directory of the College Library at UW-Madison.</description>

      <title>$18 for a two page PDF? I still don&#39;t get it.</title>

      <description>Yesterday, I saw this tweet by @Ananyo
So I clicked the link to the Nature paper and realized, &amp;ldquo;Oh, yeah. I&amp;rsquo;ve got to enter through the UW library website.&amp;rdquo;
But then I thought, &amp;ldquo;Wait&amp;hellip;$18 for a two-page Nature comment? WTF?&amp;rdquo;
So I tweeted:
And thinking about it some more, I got more annoyed, and tweeted:
And then I thought, I&amp;rsquo;ll ask Nature directly:
And they responded:
But that didn&amp;rsquo;t quite answer my question.</description>

      <description>This afternoon I refused a request from the American Journal of Human Genetics to review a paper, though the abstract was extremely interesting. AJHG is published by Elsevier, and I&amp;rsquo;d signed the declaration at http://thecostofknowledge.com to not publish or review for Elsevier journals. If only AJHG were still with the University of Chicago Press&amp;hellip;
Michael Eisen recently wrote:
I agree with him. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to turn down a review. (I do so several times a week.</description>

      <description>I am quite persuaded by Michael Eisen&amp;rsquo;s recent comments on open access:
But how can I do that if Genetics isn&amp;rsquo;t fully open? Genetics charges an extra $1200 to make an article open access. Would it really cost $1200 per article to make the journal fully open?
Another follow-up to my comments yesterday: I had suggested that copyright law might be changed to make papers coming from federal research grants fully open.</description>

      <title>Paying for scholarly publications</title>
      <link>/2012/02/02/paying-for-scholarly-publications/</link>

      <guid>/2012/02/02/paying-for-scholarly-publications/</guid>
      <description>I have a couple of papers that I should be writing, but recent discussion (the whole PIPA/SOPA thing [see Michael Eisen&amp;rsquo;s OpEd in the New York Times]; the Elsevier boycott) has turned my thoughts to publishing generally.
So I&amp;rsquo;ll take some time out (way too much time out) to comment on the value and costs of publishing and peer review, how to pay for it, PubMedCentral, etc.
The value of publishing Obviously the most important thing is to communicate the results of research.</description>

      <title>Elsevier boycott</title>
      <link>/2012/02/01/elsevier-boycott/</link>

      <description>I expect you&amp;rsquo;ve already heard about the Elsevier boycott, started based on comments from Timothy Gowers. While he focused on his own discipline (mathematics), the boycott site now has people broken down by subject. On 1 Feb, there were 2700+ signatories, including 600+ mathematicians (but only 15 statisticians). There have been a couple of articles about this in the Chronicle of Higher Education: here and here.
I signed the boycott, and will refuse to review papers for Evilsevier journals, and will try to steer my coauthors away from them.</description>
