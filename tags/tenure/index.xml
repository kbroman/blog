      <description>The transition from graduate student or postdoc to tenure-track faculty member is hard. You discover that there are a ton of new things to learn.
Here are some thoughts on things to avoid.
  You may see lots of ways in which your department could be improved; don&amp;rsquo;t try to fix all of them at once.
  You may see needs for many new courses. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to develop all of them.</description>

      <title>How to evaluate faculty?</title>

      <description>&amp;hellip;rate their departments.
The tenure guidelines for the Physical Sciences Division at UW-Madison include the following instructions (see section I-1 on page 11):
They use the ranking of a referee&amp;rsquo;s institution as an indication of his/her ability to evaluate the importance of a candidate&amp;rsquo;s work.
This disgusts me.
I like the analogy of measuring the importance of an academic paper by the &amp;ldquo;impact factor&amp;rdquo; of the journal in which it appeared, with measuring the quality of a researcher by the quality of his/her institution.</description>
