      <description>The UW Health nurses have been seeking recognition of their union. UW Health claims that it cannot legally recognize their union, but Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul issued an opinion that UW Health can voluntarily recognize their union. Yesterday, the nurses voted to hold a 3-day strike, Sept 13-15, 2022. (See the articles in the Wisconsin State Journal and the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel.)
