      <description>QR codes are stupid. See the well-known flowchart.
And I don&amp;rsquo;t like Drupal. Sites that use it give things URLs like http://www.genetics.wisc.edu/node/577 for their seminar list.
And can we get rid of the www?
 &#34;What&#39;s your web site?&#34; &#34;double-u double-u double-u ...&#34; &#34;Zzz...&#34;  URLs should be meaningful and short. I like deep hierarchies of folders, but it makes for long URLs.
URL-shorteners help, but you don&amp;rsquo;t really want to read out (or type) one of those short URLs.</description>
