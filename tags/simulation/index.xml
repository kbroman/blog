      <description>I was playing Chutes &amp;amp; Ladders with my four-year-old daughter yesterday, and I thought, &amp;ldquo;How long is this going to take?&amp;rdquo;
I saw an interesting mathematical analysis of the game a few years ago, but it seems to be offline, though you can read it via the wayback machine.
But that didn&amp;rsquo;t answer my specific question, namely, &amp;ldquo;How long is this going to take?&amp;rdquo;
So I wrote a bit of R code to simulate the game.</description>
