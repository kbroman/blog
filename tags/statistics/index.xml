      <description>Three years ago this week, I wrote a blog post, &amp;ldquo;Data science is statistics&amp;rdquo;. I was fiercely against the term at that time, as I felt that we already had a data science, and it was called Statistics.
It was a short post, so I might as well quote the whole thing:
When physicists do mathematics, they don&#39;t say they&#39;re doing &#34;number science&#34;. They&#39;re doing math. If you&#39;re analyzing data, you&#39;re doing statistics.</description>

      <title>Memories of past JSMs</title>

      <description>The Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) are the big statistics meetings in North America, &amp;ldquo;joint&amp;rdquo; among the American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, International Biometric Society (ENAR and WNAR), Statistical Society of Canada, and others.
JSM 2015 is next week, in Seattle. In anticipation, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write down some of my main memories of past JSMs.  The first JSM I attended was in 1993, in San Francisco. Since I was local at the time (a grad student at Berkeley), I got free registration in return for some small service work.</description>

      <title>Reform academic statistics</title>
      <link>http://kbroman.org/blog/2014/05/01/reform-academic-statistics/</link>

      <description>Terry Speed recently gave a talk on the role of statisticians in &amp;ldquo;Big Data&amp;rdquo; initiatives (see the video or just look at the slides). He points to the history of statisticians&amp;rsquo; discussions of massive data sets (e.g., the Proceedings of a 1998 NRC workshop on Massive data sets) and how this history is being ignored in the current Big Data hype, and that statisticians, generally, are being ignored.
I was thinking of writing a polemic on the need for reform of academic statistics and biostatistics, but in reading back over Simply Statistics posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that Rafael Irizarry and Jeff Leek have already said what I wanted to say, and so I think I&amp;rsquo;ll just summarize their points.</description>
