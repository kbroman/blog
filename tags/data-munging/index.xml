      <description>So I was trying to parse this gff file from MGI, with mouse gene annotations. And, well, I’m an idiot. But in a way that is potentially instructive.
The documentation for the file is a docx file (not really a recommended format for such metadata), but it seems rather simple, really: tab delimited, with 9 columns, the ninth column being a bunch of pasted attributes that needs to be further parsed, but we’ll skip over that detail.</description>
