      <description>This is the fifth and final installment of my &amp;ldquo;Karl is so naive&amp;rdquo; series.
I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently become aware of the big conflict between graduate student mentors&#39; dual roles of advisor and employer. Now I see it everywhere.

Should they help out at a software workshop or take on a teaching assistant position or spend the summer doing an internship in industry?</description>
