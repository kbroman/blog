      <description>For the problem I reported yesterday, in which my R package was working fine locally but failing on Travis, the key solution is to run update.packages(ask=FALSE) locally, and maybe even update.packages(ask=FALSE, type=&amp;quot;source&amp;quot;) to be sure to grab the source of packages for which binaries are not yet available. I now know to do that.
In addition, it&amp;rsquo;d be useful to have session information (R and package versions) in the results from Travis.</description>
